<p>There is good reason to think
that the lady to whom the following

the end of her life, regard
their ultimate publication as unlikely;
and it is by her family that
they have been entrusted to the

<p><i>The happy circumstance that the
fifty-seventh year since you watched at
the death-bed of Keats finds you still
among us, makes it impossible to inscribe
any other name than yours in
front of these letters, intimately connected
as they are with the decline of the poet’s
life, concerning the latter part of which
you alone have full knowledge.</i></p>

<p><i>It cannot be but that some of the letters
will give you pain,—and notably the three
written when the poet’s face was already
turned towards that land whither you
accompanied him, whence he knew there
was no return for him, and where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
still live near the hallowed place of his
burial. All who love Keats’s memory
must share such pain in the contemplation
of his agony of soul. But you who
love him having known, and we who love
him unknown except by faith in what is
written, must alike rejoice in the good
hap that has preserved, for our better
knowledge of his heart, these vivid and
varied transcripts of his inner life during
his latter years,—must alike be content to
take the knowledge with such alloy of
pain as the hapless turn of events rendered
inevitable.</i></p>

<p><i>On a memorable occasion it was said
of you by a great poet and prophet that,
had he known of the circumstances of
your unwearied attendance at the death-bed,
he should have been tempted to add
his “tribute of applause to the more solid
recompense which the virtuous man finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
in the recollection of his own motives;”
and he uttered the wish that the “unextinguished
Spirit” of Keats might “plead
against Oblivion” for your name. Were
any such plea needed, the Spirit to prefer
it, then unextinguished, is now known for
inextinguishable; and whithersoever the
name of “our Adonais” travels, there
will yours also be found.</i></p>

<p><i>This opportunity may not unfitly serve
to record my gratitude for your ready
kindness in affording me information on
various points concerning your friend’s
life and death, and also for the permission
to engrave your solemn portraiture of the
beautiful countenance seen, as you only
of all men living saw it, in its final
agony.</i></p>

<p>Transcriber’s Note: Despite the date on the title page, this is the 1888
edition (see date at end of introduction). The front matter from the
prior edition of 1878 seems to have been carried across to this one
without being fully checked and updated. This edition doesn’t have an

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The sympathetic and discerning biographer
of John Keats says, in the
memoir prefixed to Moxon’s edition of
the Poems<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, “The publication of three
small volumes of verse, some earnest
friendships, one profound passion, and
a premature death are the main incidents
here to be recorded.” These
words have long become “household
words,” at all events in the household
of those who make the lives and works
of English poets their special study;
and nothing is likely to be discovered
which shall alter the fact thus set forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
But that documents illustrating the fact
should from time to time come to the
surface, is to be expected; and the
present volume portrays the “one profound
passion” as perfectly as it is
possible for such a passion to be portrayed
without the revelation of things
too sacred for even the most reverent
and worshipful public gaze, while it
gives considerable insight into the
refinements of a nature only too keenly
sensitive to pain and injury and the
inherent hardness of things mundane.</p>

<p>The three final years of Keats’s life
are in all respects the fullest of vivid
interest for those who, admiring the
poet and loving the memory of the
man, would fain form some conception
of the working of those forces within
him which went to the shaping of his
greatest works and his greatest woes.
In those three years were produced
most of the compositions wherein the
lover of poetry can discern the supreme
hand of a master, the ultimate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
sovereign perfection beyond which, in
point of quality, the poet could never
have gone had he lived a hundred years,
whatever he might have done in magnitude
and variety; and in those years
sprang up and grew the one passion of
his life, sweet to him as honey in the
intervals of brightness and unimpeded
vigour which he enjoyed, bitter as
wormwood in those times of sickness
and poverty and the deepening shadow
of death which we have learned to
associate almost constantly with our
thoughts of him.</p>

<p>Of certain phases of his life during
these final years we have long had substantial
and most fascinating records in
the beautiful collection of documents
entrusted to Lord Houghton, and to
what admirable purpose used, all who
name the name of Keats know too well
to need reminding,—documents published,
it is true, under certain restrictions,
and subject to the depreciatory
operation of asterisks and blanks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
varying significance and magnitude,
proper enough, no doubt, thirty years
ago, but surely now a needless affliction.
But of the all-important phases in the
healthy and morbid psychology of the
poet connected with the over-mastering
passion of his latter days, the record
was necessarily scanty,—a few hints
scattered through the letters written in
moderately good health, and a few
agonized and burning utterances wrung
from him, in the despair of his soul, in
those last three letters addressed to
Charles Brown,—one during the sea
voyage and two after the arrival of
Keats and Severn in Italy.</p>

<p>It was with the profoundest feeling
of the sacredness as well as the great
importance of the record entrusted to
me that I approached the letters now at
length laid before the public: after
reading them through, it seemed to me
that I knew Keats to some extent as a
different being from the Keats I had
known; the features of his mind took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
clearer form; and certain mental and
moral characteristics not before evident
made their appearance. It remained to
consider whether this enhanced knowledge
of so noble a soul should be
confined to two or three persons, or
should not rather be given to the world
at large; and the decision arrived at
was that the world’s claim to participate
in the gift of these letters was
good.</p>

<p>The office of editor was not an arduous
one so far as the text is concerned,
for the letters are wholly free from anything
which it seems desirable to omit;
they are legibly and, except in some
minute and trivial details, correctly
written, leaving little to do beyond the
correction of a few obvious clerical
errors, and such amendment of punctuation
as is invariably required by letters
not written for the press. The arrangement
of the series in proper sequence,
however, was not nearly so simple a
matter; for, except as regards the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
nine, the evidence in this behalf is
almost wholly inferential and collateral;
and I have had to be content with strong
probability in many cases in which it is
impossible to arrive at any absolute
certainty. Of the whole thirty-seven
letters, not one bears the date of the
year, except as furnished in the postmarks
of numbers I to IX; two only go
so far as to specify in writing the day of
the month, or even the month itself;
and one of these two Keats has dated a
day later than the date shewn by the
postmark. Those which passed through
the post, numbers I to IX, are fully
addressed to “Miss Brawne, Wentworth
Place, Hampstead,” the word “Middx.”
being added in the case of the six from
the country, but not in that of the three
from London. Numbers X to XVII and
XIX to XXXII are addressed simply
to “Miss Brawne”; while numbers
XVIII, XXXIII, XXXIV, and XXXVI
are addressed to “Mrs. Brawne,” and
numbers XXXV and XXXVII bear
no address whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<p>These material details are not without
a psychological significance: the total
absence of interest in the progress of
time (the sordid current time) tallies
with the profound worship of things so
remote as perfect beauty; and the
addressing of four of the letters to
Mrs. Brawne instead of Miss Brawne
indicates, to my mind, not mere
accident, but a sensitiveness to observation
from any unaccustomed quarter:
three of the letters so addressed were
certainly written at Kentish Town, and
would not be likely to be sent by the
same hand usually employed to take
those written while the poet was next
door to his betrothed; the other one
was, I have no doubt, sent only from
one house to the other; but perhaps the
usual messenger may have chanced to
be out of the way.</p>

<p>The letters fall naturally into three
groups, namely (1) those written during
Keats’s sojourn with Charles Armitage
Brown in the Isle of Wight, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
brief stay in lodgings in Westminster in
the Summer and Autumn of 1819, (2)
those written from Brown’s house in
Wentworth Place during Keats’s illness
in the early part of 1820 and sent by
hand to Mrs. Brawne’s house, next door,
and (3) those written after he was able
to leave Wentworth Place to stay with
Leigh Hunt at Kentish Town, and
before his departure for Italy in September,
1820. Of the order of the first
and last groups there is no reasonable
doubt; and, although there can be no
absolute certainty in regard to the whole
series of the central group, I do not
think any important error will have been
made in the arrangement here adopted.</p>

<p>The slight service to be done beside
this of arranging the letters, involving a
great deal of minute investigation, was
simply to elucidate as far as possible by
brief foot-notes references that were not
self-explanatory, to give such attainable
particulars of the principal persons and
places concerned as are desirable by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
way of illustration, and to fix as nearly
as may be the chronology of that part
of Keats’s life at the time represented
by these letters,—especially the two
important dates involved. The first
date is that of the passion which Keats
conceived for Miss Brawne,—the second
that of the rupture of a blood-vessel,
marking distinctly the poet’s graveward
tendency,—two events probably connected
with some intimacy, and concerning
which it is not unnoteworthy
that we should have to be making
guesses at all. If these and other conjectural
conclusions turn out to be inaccurate
(which I do not think will be
the case), they can only be proved so
by the production of more documents;
and if documents be produced confuting
my conclusions, my aim will have been
attained by two steps instead of one.</p>

<p>The lady to whom these letters were
addressed was born on the 9th of
August in the year 1800, and baptized
Frances, though, as usual with bearers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
of that name, she was habitually called
Fanny. Her father, Mr. Samuel Brawne,
a gentleman of independent means,
died while she was still a child; and
Mrs. Brawne then went to reside at
Hampstead, with her three children,
Fanny, Samuel, and Margaret. Samuel,
being next in age to Fanny, was a youth
going to school in 1819; and Margaret
was many years younger than her sister,
being in fact a child at the time of the
engagement to Keats, which event took
place certainly between the Autumn of
1818 and the Summer of 1819, and
probably, as I find good reason to
suppose, quite early in the year 1819.
In the Summer of 1818 Mrs. Brawne
and her children occupied the house of
Charles Armitage Brown next to that
of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wentworth
Dilke, in Wentworth Place, Hampstead,
which is not now known by that name.
On Brown’s return from Scotland, the
Brawne’s moved to another house in the
neighbourhood; but they afterwards returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
to Wentworth Place, occupying
the house of Mr. Dilke. Mr. Severn
remembered that when he visited Keats
during the residence of the poet with
Brown, Keats used to take his visitor
“next door” to call upon the Brawne
family. “The house was double,”
wrote Mr. Severn, “and had side
entrances.”</p>

<p>It is said to have been at the house
of Mr. Dilke, who was the grandfather
of the present Baronet of that name,
that Keats first met Miss Brawne. Mr.
Dilke eventually gave up possession of
his residence in Wentworth Place, and
took quarters in Great Smith Street,
Westminster, where he and Mrs. Dilke
went to live in order that their only child,
bearing his father’s name, and afterwards
the first Baronet, might be educated at
Westminster School.</p>

<p>Keats’s well known weakness in regard
to the statement of dates leaves us
without such assistance as might be expected
from his general correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
in fixing the date of this first meeting
with Miss Brawne. I learn from members
of her family that it was certainly
in 1818; and, as far as I can judge, it
must have been in the last quarter of
that year; for it seems pretty evident
that he had not conceived the passion,
which was his “pleasure and torment,”
up to the end of October, and had conceived
it before Tom’s death “early in
December”; and, as he says in <a href="#LETTER_III">Letter
III</a> of the present series, “the very first
week I knew you I wrote myself your
vassal,” we must perforce regard the
date of first meeting as between the
end of October and the beginning of
December, 1818.</p>

<p>In conducting the reader to this conclusion
it will be necessary to remove a
misapprehension which has been current
for nearly thirty years in regard to a
passage in the letter that yields us our
starting-point. This is the long letter
to George Keats, dated the 29th of
October, 1818, given in Lord Houghton’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
<cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and commencing at
page 227 of Vol. I, wherein is the following
passage:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Misses —— are very kind to
me, but they have lately displeased me
much, and in this way:—now I am
coming the Richardson!—On my return,
the first day I called, they were in a sort
of taking or bustle about a cousin of theirs,
who, having fallen out with her grandpapa
in a serious manner, was invited by
Mrs. —— to take asylum in her house.
She is an East-Indian, and ought to be
her grandfather’s heir. At the time I
called, Mrs. —— was in conference with
her up stairs, and the young ladies were
warm in her praise down stairs, calling
her genteel, interesting, and a thousand
other pretty things, to which I gave no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
heed, not being partial to nine days’
wonders. Now all is completely
changed: they hate her, and, from
what I hear, she is not without faults of
a real kind; but she has others, which
are more apt to make women of inferior
claims hate her. She is not a Cleopatra,
but is, at least, a Charmian: she has a
rich Eastern look; she has fine eyes, and
fine manners. When she comes into the
room she makes the same impression as
the beauty of a leopardess. She is too
fine and too conscious of herself to repulse
any man who may address her:
from habit she thinks that <em>nothing particular</em>.
I always find myself more at ease
with such a woman: the picture before
me always gives me a life and animation
which I cannot possibly feel with anything
inferior. I am, at such times, too
much occupied in admiring to be awkward
or in a tremble: I forget myself
entirely, because I live in her. You will,
by this time, think I am in love with
her, so, before I go any further, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
tell you I am not. She kept me awake
one night, as a tune of Mozart’s might
do. I speak of the thing as a pastime
and an amusement, than which I can
feel none deeper than a conversation
with an imperial woman, the very ‘yes’
and ‘no’ of whose life is to me a banquet.
I don’t cry to take the moon
home with me in my pocket, nor do I
fret to leave her behind me. I like her,
and her like, because one has no <em>sensations</em>:
what we both are is taken for
granted. You will suppose I have, by
this, had much talk with her—no such
thing; there are the Misses —— on the
look out. They think I don’t admire
her because I don’t stare at her; they
call her a flirt to me—what a want of
knowledge! She walks across a room
in such a manner that a man is drawn
towards her with a magnetic power; this
they call flirting! They do not know
things; they do not know what a woman
is. I believe, though, she has faults, the
same as Charmian and Cleopatra might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
have had. Yet she is a fine thing, speaking
in a worldly way; for there are two
distinct tempers of mind in which we
judge of things—the worldly, theatrical
and pantomimical; and the unearthly,
spiritual and ethereal. In the former,
Bonaparte, Lord Byron, and this Charmian,
hold the first place in our minds;
in the latter, John Howard, Bishop
Hooker rocking his child’s cradle, and
you, my dear sister, are the conquering
feelings. As a man of the world, I love
the rich talk of a Charmian; as an
eternal being, I love the thought of you.
I should like her to ruin me, and I
should like you to save me.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘I am free from men of pleasure’s cares,</div>
<div class="verse">By dint of feelings far more deep than theirs.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is ‘Lord Byron,’ and is one of the
finest things he has said.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now it is clear from this passage that
a lady had made a certain impression
on Keats; and Lord Houghton in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
latest publication states explicitly what
is only indicated in general terms in
the Memoirs published in 1848 and
1867,—that the lady here described
was Miss Brawne. In the earlier
Memoirs, three letters to Rice, Woodhouse,
and Reynolds follow the long
letter to George Keats; then comes the
statement that “the lady alluded to in
the above pages inspired Keats with
the passion that only ceased with his
existence”; and, as the letter to Reynolds
contains references to a lady, it
might have been possible to regard
Lord Houghton’s expression as an allusion
to that letter only. But in the
brief and masterly Memoir prefixed to
the Aldine Edition of Keats<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, his Lordship
cites the passage from the letter of
the 29th of October as descriptive of
Miss Brawne,—thus confirming by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
explicit statement what has all along
passed current as tradition in literary
circles.</p>

<p>When Lord Houghton’s inestimable
volumes of 1848 were given to the
world there might have been indelicacy
in making too close a scrutiny into the
bearings of these passages; but the
time has now come when such cannot
be the case; and I am enabled to give
the grounds on which it is absolutely
certain that the allusion here was not
to Miss Brawne. As Lord Houghton
has elsewhere recorded, Keats met Miss
Brawne at the house of Mr. and Mrs.
Dilke, who had no daughters, while the
relationship of “the Misses ——” and
“Mrs. ——” of the passage in question
is clearly that of mother and daughters.
Mrs. Brawne had already been settled with
her children at Hampstead for several
years at this time, whereas this cousin
of “the Misses ——” had just arrived
when Keats returned there from Teignmouth.
The “Charmian” of this anecdote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
was an East-Indian, having a
grandfather to quarrel with; while Miss
Brawne never had a grandfather living
during her life, and her family had not
the remotest connexion with the East
Indies. Moreover, Keats’s sister, who
is still happily alive, assures me positively
that the reference is not to Miss
Brawne. In regard to the blank for a
surname, I had judged from various
considerations internal and external
that it should be filled by that of
Reynolds; and, on asking Mr. Severn
(without expressing any view whatever)
whether he knew to whom the story
related, he wrote to me that he knew
the story well from Keats, and that the
reference is to the Misses Reynolds, the
sisters of John Hamilton Reynolds.
Mr. Severn does not know the name of
the cousin of these ladies.</p>

<p>It is clear then that the lady who had
impressed Keats some little time before
the 29th of October, 1818, and was
still fresh in his mind, was not Fanny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
Brawne. That the impression was not
lasting the event shewed; and we may
safely assume that it was really limited
in the way which Keats himself
averred,—that he was not “in love with
her.” But it is incredible, almost, that, in
his affectionate frankness with his brother,
he would ever have written thus of
another woman, had he been already
enamoured of Fanny Brawne. This
view is strengthened by reading the
letter to the end: in such a perusal we
come upon the following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Notwithstanding your happiness and
your recommendations, I hope I shall
never marry: though the most beautiful
creature were waiting for me at the
end of a journey or a walk; though the
carpet were of silk, and the curtains of
the morning clouds, the chairs and
sofas stuffed with cygnet’s down, the
food manna, the wine beyond claret, the
window opening on Winandermere, I
should not feel, or rather my happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
should not be, so fine; my solitude is
sublime—for, instead of what I have
described, there is a sublimity to welcome
me home; the roaring of the
wind is my wife; and the stars through
my window-panes are my children; the
mighty abstract Idea of Beauty in all
things, I have, stifles the more divided
and minute domestic happiness. An
amiable wife and sweet children I contemplate
as part of that Beauty, but I
must have a thousand of those beautiful
particles to fill up my heart. I feel more
and more every day, as my imagination
strengthens, that I do not live in this
world alone, but in a thousand worlds.
No sooner am I alone, than shapes of
epic greatness are stationed around me,
and serve my spirit the office which is
equivalent to a King’s Body-guard:
‘then Tragedy with scepter’d pall comes
sweeping by:’ according to my state of
mind, I am with Achilles shouting in the
trenches, or with Theocritus in the vales
of Sicily; or throw my whole being into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
Troilus, and, repeating those lines, ‘I
wander like a lost soul upon the Stygian
bank, staying for waftage,’ I melt into
the air with a voluptuousness so delicate,
that I am content to be alone. Those
things, combined with the opinion I
have formed of the generality of women,
who appear to me as children to whom
I would rather give a sugar-plum than
my time, form a barrier against matrimony
which I rejoice in. I have
written this that you might see that I
have my share of the highest pleasures
of life, and that though I may choose
to pass my days alone, I shall be no
solitary; you see there is nothing
splenetic in all this. The only thing
that can ever affect me personally for
more than one short passing day, is any
doubt about my powers of poetry: I
seldom have any, and I look with hope
to the nighing time when I shall have
none.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>There is but little after this in the
letter, and apparently no break between
the time at which he thus expressed
himself and that at which he
signed the letter and added—“This is
my birthday.” If therefore my conclusion
as to the negative value of this
and the “Charmian” passage be correct,
we may say that he was certainly not
enamoured of Miss Brawne up to the
29th of October, 1818, although it is
tolerably clear, from the evidence of
Mr. Dilke, that Keats first met her
about October or November. Again,
in a highly interesting and important
letter to Keats’s most intimate friend
John Hamilton Reynolds, a letter
which Lord Houghton placed immediately
after one to Woodhouse dated
the 18th of December, 1818, we read
the following ominous passage suggesting
a doom not long to be deferred:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I never was in love, yet the voice
and shape of a woman has haunted me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
these two days—at such a time when
the relief, the feverish relief of poetry,
seems a much less crime. This morning
poetry has conquered—I have relapsed
into those abstractions which are my
only life—I feel escaped from a new,
strange, and threatening sorrow, and I
am thankful for it. There is an awful
warmth about my heart, like a load of
Immortality.</p>

<p>“Poor Tom—that woman and poetry
were ringing changes in my senses.
Now I am, in comparison, happy.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is no date to this letter; and,
although it was most reasonable to
suppose that the fervid expressions used
pointed to the real heroine of the poet’s
tragedy,—that he wrote in one of those
moments of mastery of the intellect over
the emotions such as he experienced
when writing the extraordinary fifth
Letter of the present series,—the fact is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
that the reference is to “Charmian,” and
that the letter was misplaced by Lord
Houghton. It really belongs to September
1818, and should precede instead
of following this “Charmian” letter.</p>

<p>When Keats wrote the next letter in
Lord Houghton’s series (also undated)
to George and his wife, Tom was dead;
and there is another clue to the date in
the fact that he transcribes a letter from
Miss Jane Porter dated the 4th of
December, 1818. After making this
transcript he proceeds to draw the following
verbal portrait of a young lady:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Shall I give you Miss ——? She
is about my height, with a fine style of
countenance of the lengthened sort; she
wants sentiment in every feature; she
manages to make her hair look well;
her nostrils are very fine, though a little
painful; her mouth is bad and good;
her profile is better than her full face,
which, indeed, is not full, but pale and
thin, without showing any bone; her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
shape is very graceful, and so are her
movements; her arms are good, her
hands bad-ish, her feet tolerable. She
is not seventeen, but she is ignorant;
monstrous in her behaviour, flying out
in all directions, calling people such
names that I was forced lately to make
use of the term—Minx: this is, I think,
from no innate vice, but from a penchant
she has for acting stylishly. I am,
however, tired of such style, and shall
decline any more of it. She had a
friend to visit her lately; you have
known plenty such—she plays the
music, but without one sensation but
the feel of the ivory at her fingers; she
is a downright Miss, without one set-off.
We hated her, and smoked her,
and baited her, and, I think, drove her
away. Miss ——, thinks her a paragon
of fashion, and says she is the only
woman in the world she would change
persons with. What a stupe,—she is as
superior as a rose to a dandelion.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing explicit as to the
date of this passage; but there is no
longer any doubt that this sketch has
reference to Miss Brawne, and that
Keats had now found that most dangerous
of objects a woman “alternating
attraction and repulsion.”</p>

<p>The lady’s children assured me that
the description answered to the facts
in every particular except that of age:
the correct expression would be “not
nineteen”; but Keats was not infallible
on such a point; and the holograph
letter in which he wrote “Miss Brawne”
in full shews that he made a mistake
as to her age. When he wrote this passage,
he was, I should judge, feeling a
certain resentment analogous to what
found a much more tender expression
in the first letter of the present series,
when the circumstances made increased
tenderness a matter of course,—a resentment
of the feeling that he was becoming
enslaved.</p>

<p>There is no announcement of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
engagement in the original letter to his
brother and sister-in-law, which I have
read; and it would seem improbable
that he was engaged when he wrote
it. But of the journal letter begun
on the 14th of February, 1819, and
finished on the 3rd of May, only a
part of the holograph is accessible;
and there may possibly have been
such an announcement in the missing
part, while, under some date between
the 19th of March and the 15th of
April, Keats writes the following paragraph
and sonnet, from which it might
be inferred that the engagement had
been announced in an unpublished
letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am afraid that your anxiety for
me leads you to fear for the violence of
my temperament, continually smothered
down: for that reason, I did not intend
to have sent you the following Sonnet;
but look over the two last pages, and
ask yourself if I have not that in me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
which will bear the buffets of the world.
It will be the best comment on my
Sonnet; it will show you that it was
written with no agony but that of
ignorance, with no thirst but that of
knowledge, when pushed to the point;
though the first steps to it were through
my human passions, they went away,
and I wrote with my mind, and, perhaps,
I must confess, a little bit of my heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">No God, no Demon of severe response,</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span></p>

<p>Again in the same letter, on the 15th
of April, Keats says “Brown, this morning,
is writing some Spenserian stanzas
against Miss B —— and me,”—a reference,
doubtless, to Miss Brawne, probably indicative
of the engagement being an
understood thing; and, seemingly on the
same date, he writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The fifth canto of Dante pleases me
more and more; it is that one in which
he meets with Paulo and Francesca. I
had passed many days in rather a low
state of mind, and in the midst of them
I dreamt of being in that region of Hell.
The dream was one of the most delightful
enjoyments I ever had in my life; I
floated about the wheeling atmosphere,
as it is described, with a beautiful figure,
to whose lips mine were joined, it
seemed for an age; and in the midst of
all this cold and darkness I was warm;
ever-flowery tree-tops sprung up, and
we rested on them, sometimes with the
lightness of a cloud, till the wind blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
us away again. I tried a Sonnet on it:
there are fourteen lines in it, but nothing
of what I felt. Oh! that I could dream
it every night.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">As Hermes once took to his feathers light,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon’d and slept,</div>
<div class="verse">So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">So play’d, so charm’d, so conquer’d, so bereft</div>
<div class="verse">The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And seeing it asleep, so fled away,</div>
<div class="verse">Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor unto Tempe, where Jove grieved a day,</div>
<div class="verse">But to that second circle of sad Hell,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw</div>
<div class="verse">Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Their sorrows,—pale were the sweet lips I saw,</div>
<div class="verse">Pale were the lips I kiss’d, and fair the form</div>
<div class="verse">I floated with, about that melancholy storm.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>The meaning of this dream is sufficiently
clear without any light from the
fact that the sonnet itself was written in
a little volume given by Keats to Miss
Brawne, a volume of Taylor &amp; Hessey’s
miniature edition of Cary’s Dante, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
had remained up to the year 1877 in
the possession of that lady’s family.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Although the present citation of extant
documents does not avail to fix the
date of Keats’s passion more nearly than
to shew that it almost certainly lies
somewhere between the 29th of October
and beginning of December, 1818, there
can be little doubt that, if a competent
person should be permitted to examine
all the original documents concerned,
the date might be ascertained much
more nearly;—that is to say that the
particular “first week” of acquaintance
in which Keats “wrote himself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
vassal” of Miss Brawne, as he says (<a href="#Page_13">see
page 13</a>), might be identified. But in
any case it must be well to bring into
juxtaposition these passages bearing upon
the subject of the letters now made
public.</p>

<p>The natural inference from all we
know of the matter in hand is that after
his brother Tom’s death, Keats’s passion
had more time and more temptation
to feed upon itself; and that, as an
unoccupied man living in the same
village with the object of that passion,
an avowal followed pretty speedily. It
is not surprising that there are no letters
to shew for the first half of the
year 1819, during which Keats and Miss
Brawne probably saw each other constantly,
and to judge from the expressions
in <a href="#LETTER_XI">Letter XI</a>, were in the habit of
walking out together.</p>

<p>The tone of <a href="#LETTER_I">Letter I</a> is unsuggestive
of more than a few weeks’ engagement;
but it is impossible, on this alone, to
found safely any conclusion whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
From the date of that letter, the 3rd of
July, 1819, we have plainer sailing for
awhile: Keats appears to have remained
in the Isle of Wight till the 11th or
12th of August, when he and Brown
crossed from Cowes to Southampton
and proceeded to Winchester. At <a href="#Page_19">page
19</a> we read under the date “9 August,”
“This day week we shall move to Winchester”;
but in the letter bearing the
postmark of the 16th (though dated the
17th) Keats says he has been in Winchester
four days; so that the patience
of the friends with Shanklin did not
hold out for anything like a week.</p>

<p>At Winchester the poet remained till
the 11th of September, when bad news
from George Keats hurried him up to
Town for a few days: he meant to have
returned on the 15th, and was certainly
there again by the 22nd, remaining
until some day between the 1st and
10th of October, by which date he
seems to have taken up his abode at
lodgings in College Street, Westminster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
Here he cannot have remained long;
for on the 19th he was already proposing
to return to Hampstead; and it must
have been very soon after this that he
accepted the invitation of Brown to
“domesticate with” him again at Wentworth
Place; and on the 19th of the
next month he was writing from that
place to his friend and publisher, Taylor.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>This brings us to the fatal winter of
1819-20, during which, until the date of
Keats’s first bad illness, we should not
expect any more letters to Miss Brawne,
because, in the natural course of things,
he would be seeing her daily.</p>

<p>The absence of any current record as
to the exact date whereon he was struck
down with that particular phase of his
malady which he himself felt from the
first to be fatal, must have seemed
peculiarly regretworthy to Keats’s lovers;
but it is not impossible to deduce from
the various materials at command the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
day to which Lord Houghton’s account
refers. This well-known passage leaves
us in no doubt as to the place wherein
the beginning of the end came upon the
poet,—the house of Charles Brown; but
the day we must seek for ourselves.</p>

<p>Passing over such premonitions of
disease as that recorded in the letter to
George Keats and his wife dated the
14th of February, 1819, and printed at
page 257 of the first volume of the
<cite>Life</cite>, namely that he had “kept in doors
lately, resolved, if possible, to rid” himself
of “sore throat,”—the first date important
to bear in mind is Thursday, the
13th of January, 1820, which is given
at the head of a somewhat remarkable
version of a well-known letter addressed
to Mrs. George Keats. This letter first
appeared without date in the <cite>Life</cite>; but,
on the 25th of June, 1877, it was printed
in the New York <cite>World</cite>, with many
striking variations from the previous
text, and with several additions, including
the date already quoted, the genuineness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
of which I can see no reason for
doubting. The letter begins thus in
the <cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite>—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“My dear Sister,</p>

<p>By the time you receive this
your troubles will be over, and George
have returned to you.”</p>

</div>

<p>In <cite>The World</cite> it opens thus—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My dear Sis.: By the time that you
receive this your troubles will be over.
I wish you knew that they were half
over; I mean that George is safe in
England, and in good health.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is not my part to account here for
the <em>verbal</em> inconsistency between these
two versions; but the inconsistency as
regards <em>fact</em>, which has been charged
against them, is surely not real. Both
versions alike indicate that Keats was
writing with the knowledge that his
letter would not reach Mrs. George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
Keats till after the return of her husband
from his sudden and short visit to
England; and, assuming the genuineness
of another document, this was
certainly the case.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Philobiblion</cite><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> for August, 1862,
was printed a fragment purporting to be
from a letter of Keats’s, which seems to
me, on internal evidence alone, of indubitable
authenticity; and, if it is
Keats’s, it must belong to the particular
letter now under consideration. It is
headed <i>Friday 27th</i>, is written in higher
spirits, if anything, than the rest of this
brilliant letter, giving a ludicrous string
of comparisons for Mrs. George Keats’s
sister-in-law, Mrs. Henry Wylie, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>
together with a final joke, were apparently
deemed unripe for publication in
1848, being represented by asterisks in
the <cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite> (Vol. II, p. 49).
The fragment closes with the promise of
“a close written sheet on the first of
next month,” varying in phrase, just as
the <cite>World</cite> version of the whole letter
varies, from Lord Houghton’s.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Keats explains, under the inaccurate
and unexplicit date <i>Friday 27th</i>, that
he has been writing a letter for George
to take back to his wife, has unfortunately
forgotten to bring it to town, and
will have to send it on to Liverpool,
whither George has departed that morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>
“by the coach,” at six o’clock. The
27th of January, 1820, was a Thursday,
not a Friday; and there can be hardly
any doubt that George Keats left London
on the 28th of January, 1820, because
John, who professed to know
nothing of the days of the month, seems
generally to have known the days of the
week; and this Friday cannot have
been in any other month: it was after
the 13th of January, and before the 16th
of February, on which day Keats wrote
to Rice, referring to his illness.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But
whether the date at the head of the
fragment should be <i>Thursday 27th</i> or
<i>Friday 28th</i> is immaterial for our present
purpose, because the Thursday after
that date would be the same day in either
case; and it was on the Thursday after
George left London that Keats was
taken ill. This appears from the following
passage extracted by Sir Charles
Dilke from a letter of George Keat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>s’s
to John, and communicated to <cite>The
Athenæum</cite> of the 4th of August, 1877:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Louisville, June 18th, 1820.</p>

<p class="noindent">My dear John,</p>

<p>Where will our miseries end? So
soon as the Thursday after I left
London you were attacked with a dangerous
illness, an hour after I left this
for England my little girl became so ill
as to approach the grave, dragging our
dear George after her. You are recovered
(thank [<i>sic</i>] I hear the bad and
good news together), they are recovered,
and yet....”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, it was on Thursday, the 3rd of
February, 1820, that Keats, as recounted
by Lord Houghton (Vol. II, pp. 53-4),
returned home at about eleven o’clock,
“in a state of strange physical excitement,”
and told Brown he had received
a severe chill outside the stage-coach,—that
he coughed up some blood on
getting into bed, and read in its colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>
his death-warrant. Mr. Severn tells
me that Keats left his bed-room within
a week of his being taken ill: within a
fortnight, as we have seen, he was so
far better as to be writing (dismally
enough, it is true) to Rice; but, that
he was confined to the house for some
months, is evident. The whole of the
letters forming the second division of
the series, Numbers X to XXXII, seem
to me to have been written during this
confinement; and I should doubt whether
Keats did much better, if any,
than realize his hope of getting out for
a walk on the 1st of May.</p>

<p>At that time he was not sufficiently
recovered to accompany Brown on his
second tour in Scotland; and was yet
well enough by the 7th to be at Gravesend
with his friend for the final parting.
I understand from the <cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite>
(Vol. II, p. 60), that Keats then went
at once to Kentish Town: Lord Houghton
says “to lodge at Kentish Town, to
be near his friend Leigh Hunt”; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>
Hunt says in his <cite>Autobiography</cite> (1850),
Vol. II, p. 207, “On Brown’s leaving
home a second time, ... Keats, who was
too ill to accompany him, came to reside
with me, when his last and best volume
of poems appeared....”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> These accounts
are not necessarily contradictory; for
Keats may have tried lodgings <em>near</em>
Hunt first, and moved under the same
roof with his friend when the lodgings
became intolerable, as those in College
Street had done before. He was reading
the proofs of <cite>Lamia, Isabella, &amp;c.</cite>
on the 11th of June, as shown by a
letter to Taylor of that date;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and, on
the 28th, appeared in <cite>The Indicator</cite>,
beside the Sonnet</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">the paper entitled “A Now,” at the
composition of which Keats is said to
have been not only present but assisting;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and, as Hunt wrote pretty much
“from hand to mouth” for <cite>The Indicator</cite>,
we may safely assume that Keats was
with him, at all events till just the end
of June. On a second attack of spitting
of blood, he returned to Wentworth
Place to be nursed by Mrs. and Miss
Brawne; and he was writing from there
to Taylor on the 14th of August.</p>

<p>Between these two attacks he would
seem to have written the letters forming
the third series, Numbers XXXIII to
XXXVII. I suspect the desperate tone
of Number XXXVII had some weight
in bringing about the return to Wentworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
Place; and that this was the last
letter Keats ever wrote to Fanny
Brawne; for Mr. Severn tells me that
his friend was absolutely unable to
write to her either on the voyage or
in Italy.</p>

<p>There are certain passages in the letters,
taking exception to Miss Brawne’s
behaviour, particularly with Charles
Armitage Brown, which should not, I
think, be read without making good
allowance for the extreme sensitiveness
natural to Keats, and exaggerated to
the last degree by terrible misfortunes.
Keats was himself endowed with such
an exquisite refinement of nature, and,
without being in any degree a prophet
or propagandist like Shelley, was so
intensely in earnest both in art and in
life, that anything that smacked of
trifling with the sacred passion of love
must have been to him more horrible
and appalling than to most persons of
refinement and culture. Add to this
that, for the greater part of the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
during which his good or evil hap cast
him near the object of his affection, his
robust spirit of endurance was disarmed
by the advancing operations of disease,
and his discomfiture in this behalf aggravated
by material difficulties of the
most galling kind; and we need not
be surprised to find things that might
otherwise have been deemed of small
account making a violent impression
upon him. In a memoir<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of his friend
Dilke, written by that gentleman’s
grandson, there is an extract from
some letter or journal, emanating from
whom, and at what date, we are not
told, but probably from Mr. or Mrs.
Dilke, and which is significant enough:
it is at page 11:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is quite a settled thing between
Keats and Miss ——. God help them.
It’s a bad thing for them. The mother
says she cannot prevent it, and that her
only hope is that it will go off. He
don’t like anyone to look at her or to
speak to her.”</p>

</div>

<p>This indicates, at all events, a morbid
susceptibility on the part of Keats as to
the relations of his betrothed with the
rest of the world, and must be taken
into account in weighing his own words
in this connexion. That things went
uncomfortably enough to attract the
attention of others is indicated again
in an extract which Sir Charles Dilke
has published on the same page with the
foregoing, from a letter written to Mrs.
Dilke by Miss Reynolds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hear that Keats is going to Rome,
which must please all his friends on every
account. I sincerely hope it will benefit
his health, poor fellow! His mind and
spirits must be bettered by it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span>
absence may probably weaken, if not
break off, a connexion that has been a
most unhappy one for him.”</p>

</div>

<p>Unhappy, the connexion doubtless
was, as the connexion of a doomed man
with the whole world is likely to be;
but it would be unfair to assume that the
engagement to Miss Brawne took a more
unfortunate turn than any engagement
would probably take for a man circumstanced
as Keats was,—a man without
independent means, and debarred by
ill-health from earning an independence.
Above all, it would be both unsafe and
extremely unfair to conclude that either
Miss Brawne or Keats’s amiable and
admirable true friend Charles Brown
was guilty of any real levity.</p>

<p>That Keats’s passion was the cause of
his death is an assumption which also
should be looked at with reserve.
Shelley’s immortal Elegy and Byron’s
ribald stanzas have been yoked together
to draw down the track of years the
false notion that adverse criticism killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span>
him; and now that that form of murder
has been shewn not to have been committed,
there seems to be a reluctance to
admit that there was no killing in the
matter. Sir Charles Dilke says, at page
7 of the Memoir already cited, that
Keats “‘gave in’ to a passion which
killed him as surely as ever any man was
killed by love.” This may be perfectly
true; for perhaps love never did kill any
man; but surely it must be superfluous
to assume any such dire agency in the
decease of a man who had hereditary
consumption. Coleridge’s often-quoted
verdict, “There is death in that hand,”
does not stand alone; and the careful
reader of Keats’s Life and Letters will
find ample evidence of a state of health
likely to lead but to one result,—such as
the passage already cited in regard
to his staying at home determined
to rid himself of sore throat, the
account of his return, invalided, from
the tour in Scotland, which his friends
agreed he ought never to have undertaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span>
and his own statement to Mr.
Dilke, printed in the <cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite>
(Vol. II, p. 7), that he “was not in very
good health” when at Shanklin.</p>

<p>Lord Houghton’s fine perception of
character and implied fact sufficed to
prevent his giving any colour to the
supposition that Keats was not sufficiently
cherished and considered in his
latter days: the reproaches that occur
in some of the present letters do not
lead me to alter the impression conveyed
to me on this subject by his Lordship’s
memoirs; nor do I doubt that others
will make the necessary allowance for
the fevered condition of the poet’s mind
and the harassed state of body and spirit.
Mr. Severn tells me that Mrs. and Miss
Brawne felt the keenest regret that
they had not followed him and Keats to
Rome; and, indeed, I understand that
there was some talk of a marriage taking
place before the departure. Even
twenty years after Keats’s death, when
Mr. Severn returned to England, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
bereaved lady was unable to receive him
on account of the extreme painfulness
of the associations connected with him.</p>

<p>In Sir Charles Dilke’s Memoir of his
grandfather, there is a strange passage
wherein he quotes from a letter of
Miss Brawne’s written ten years after
Keats’s death,—a passage which might
lead to an inference very far from the
truth:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Keats died admired only by his
personal friends, and by Shelley; and
even ten years after his death, when
the first memoir was proposed, the
woman he had loved had so little belief
in his poetic reputation, that she wrote
to Mr. Dilke, ‘The kindest act would be
to let him rest for ever in the obscurity
to which circumstances have condemned
him.’”</p>

</div>

<p>That Miss Brawne should have written
thus at the end of ten years’ widowhood
does not by any means imply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>
weakness of belief in Keats’s fame.
Obscurity of life is not identical with
obscurity of works; and any one must
surely perceive that an application made
to her for material for a biography,
or even any proposal to publish one,
must have been intensely painful to
her. She could not bear any discussion
of him, and was, till her death in
1865, peculiarly reticent about him;
but in her latter years, as a matron
with grown-up children, when the world
had decided that Keats was not to be
left in that obscurity, she said more
than once that the letters of the poet,
which form the present volume, and
about which she was otherwise most
uncommunicative, should be carefully
guarded, “as they would some day be
considered of value.”</p>

<p>It would be irrelevant to the present
purpose to recount the facts of this
honoured lady’s life; but one or two
personal traits may be recorded. She
had the gift of independence or self-sufficingness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span>
in a high degree; and it was
not easy to turn her from a settled purpose.
This strength of character showed
itself in a noticeable manner in the great
crisis of her life, and in a manner, too,
that has to some extent robbed her of
the small credit of devotion to the man
whose love she had accepted; for those
who knew the truth would not have it
discussed, and those who decried her
did not know the truth.</p>

<p>On the news of Keats’s death, she
cut her hair short and took to a widow’s
cap and mourning. She wandered about
solitary, day after day, on Hampstead
Heath, frequently alarming the family
by staying there far into the night, and
having to be sought with lanterns.
Before friends and acquaintance she
affected a buoyancy of spirit which has
tended to wrong her memory; but her
sister carried into advanced life the
recollection that, when the stress of
keeping up appearances passed, Fanny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>
spent such time as she remained at home
in her own room,—into which the child
would peer with awe, and see the unwedded
widow poring in helpless despair
over Keats’s letters.</p>

<p>Without being in general a systematic
student she was a voluminous reader in
widely varying branches of literature;
and some out-of-the-way subjects she
followed up with great perseverance. One
of her strong points of learning was the
history of costume, in which she was so
well read as to be able to answer any
question of detail at a moment’s notice.
This was quite independent of individual
adornment; though, <i>à propos</i> of Keats’s
remark, “she manages to make her hair
look well,” it may be mentioned that
some special pains were taken in this
particular, the hair being worn in curls
over the forehead, interlaced with ribands.
She was an eager politician, with very
strong convictions, fiery and animated
in discussion; and this characteristic
she preserved till the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The sonnet on Keats’s preference for
blue eyes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Blue! ’tis the hue of heaven,” &amp;c.,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">written in reply to John Hamilton Reynolds’s
sonnet<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in which a preference is
expressed for dark eyes,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“Dark eyes are dearer far</div>
<div class="verse">Than orbs that mock the hyacinthine bell”—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">has no immediate connexion with Miss
Brawne; but it is of interest to note
that the colour of her eyes was blue, so
that the poet was faithful to his preference.
No good portrait of her is extant,
except the silhouette of which a reproduction
is given <a href="#illus2">opposite page 3</a>: a
miniature which is perhaps no longer
extant is said by her family to have
been almost worthless, while the silhouette
is regarded as characteristic and
accurate as far as such things can be.
Mr. Severn, however, told me that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[lxviii]</a></span>
draped figure in Titian’s picture of
Sacred and Profane Love, in the Borghese
Palace at Rome, resembled her
greatly, so much so that he used to
visit it frequently, and copied it, on this
account. Keats, it seems, never saw
this noble picture containing the only
satisfactory likeness of Fanny Brawne.</p>

<p>The portrait of Keats which forms
the frontispiece to this volume has been
etched by Mr. W. B. Scott from a drawing
of Severn’s, to which the following
words are attached:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“28th Jany. 3 o’clock mg. Drawn
to keep me awake—a deadly sweat was
on him all this night.”</p>

</div>

<p>Keats’s old schoolfellow, the late
Charles Cowden Clarke, assured me in
1876 that this drawing was “a marvellously
correct likeness.”</p>

<p><i>Postscript.</i>—During the past ten years
my work in connexion with the writings
and doings of Keats has involved the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[lxix]</a></span>
discovery and examination of a great
mass of documents of a more or less
authoritative kind, both printed and
manuscript; and many points which
were matters of conjecture in 1877 are
now no longer so.</p>

<p>Others also have busied themselves
about Keats; and, since the foregoing
remarks were first published in 1878,
Mr. J. G. Speed, a grandson of George
Keats, has identified himself with the
contributor to the New York <cite>World</cite>,
alluded to at pages <a href="#Page_xlviii">xlviii</a> and <a href="#Page_xlix">xlix</a>, in
reissuing in America Lord Houghton’s
edition of Keats’s Poems, together with
a collection of letters.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This work,
though containing one new letter, unhappily
threw no real light whatever
either on the inconsistencies of text
already referred to or on any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[lxx]</a></span>
question connected with Keats. Later,
Professor Sidney Colvin has issued, with
a very different result, his volume on
Keats<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> included in the “English Men of
Letters” series; and I have not hesitated
to use, without individual specification,
such illustrative facts as have become
available, whether from Mr. Colvin’s work
or from my own edition of Keats’s whole
writings,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which also appeared some
time after the publication of the Letters
to Fanny Brawne, though years before
Mr. Colvin’s book.</p>

<p>Two letters, traced since the body of
the present volume passed through the
press are added at the close of the
series; and I have now reason to think
that the letter numbered <a href="#LETTER_XXVIII">XXVIII</a> should
precede that numbered <a href="#LETTER_XXV">XXV</a>, the date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[lxxi]</a></span>
being probably the 23rd or 25th of
February, 1820, rather than the 4th of
March as suggested in the foot-note at
<a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>.</p>

<p>The cousin of the Misses Reynolds
whom Keats described as a Charmian
was Miss Jane Cox,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> at least so I was
most positively assured by Miss
Charlotte Reynolds in 1883.</p>

<p>It is now pretty clear that the intention
to return to Winchester on the
14th of September, 1819, was not carried
out quite literally, and that Keats really
returned to that city on the 15th. In
regard to the foot-note at <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>, it
should now be stated that, in a letter
post-marked the 16th of October, 1819,
he speaks of having returned to Hampstead
after lodging two or three days in
the neighbourhood of Mrs. Dilke.</p>

<p>Having mentioned in the foot-note at
<a href="#Page_101">page 101</a> that Keats had elsewhere recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[lxxii]</a></span>
himself and Tom as firm believers
in immortality, I must now state that
the record cited was a garbled one.
Lord Houghton, working from transcripts
furnished to him by the late Mr.
Jeffrey, the second husband of George
Keats’s widow, printed the words “I
have a firm belief in immortality, and
so had Tom.” The corresponding sentence
in the autograph letter is “I have
scarce a doubt of an immortality of
some kind or another, neither had
Tom.”</p>

<p>Finally, it remains to supply an omission
which I find it hard to account for.
In Medwin’s Life of Shelley occur some
important extracts about Keats, seeming
to emanate from Fanny Brawne. In
1877 I learnt from the lady’s family
that Medwin’s mysteriously introduced
correspondent was no other than she.
Indeed I had actually cut the relative
portion of Medwin’s book out for use
in this Introduction; but by some inexplicable
oversight I omitted even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span>
refer to it; and it remained for Professor
Colvin to call attention to it. I now
gladly follow his lead in citing words
which have a direct bearing upon the
vexed question of the appreciation of
Keats by her whom he loved; and, in
the appendix to the present edition, the
passage in question will be found.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Postmark</i>, Newport, 3 July, 1819.]</p>

<p class="noindent">My dearest Lady,</p>

<p>I am glad I had not an
opportunity of sending off a Letter
which I wrote for you on Tuesday
night—’twas too much like one out
of Rousseau’s Heloise. I am more
reasonable this morning. The morning
is the only proper time for me to write
to a beautiful Girl whom I love so much:
for at night, when the lonely day has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
closed, and the lonely, silent, unmusical
Chamber is waiting to receive me as into
a Sepulchre, then believe me my passion
gets entirely the sway, then I would not
have you see those Rhapsodies which I
once thought it impossible I should ever
give way to, and which I have often
laughed at in another, for fear you should
[think me<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>] either too unhappy or perhaps
a little mad. I am now at a very
pleasant Cottage window, looking onto
a beautiful hilly country, with a glimpse
of the sea; the morning is very fine. I
do not know how elastic my spirit might
be, what pleasure I might have in living
here and breathing and wandering as
free as a stag about this beautiful Coast
if the remembrance of you did not weigh
so upon me. I have never known any
unalloy’d Happiness for many days
together: the death or sickness of some
one<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> has always spoilt my hours—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
now when none such troubles oppress
me, it is you must confess very hard
that another sort of pain should haunt
me. Ask yourself my love whether
you are not very cruel to have so
entrammelled me, so destroyed my
freedom. Will you confess this in the
Letter you must write immediately and
do all you can to console me in it—make
it rich as a draught of poppies to
intoxicate me—write the softest words
and kiss them that I may at least touch
my lips where yours have been. For
myself I know not how to express my
devotion to so fair a form: I want a
brighter word than bright, a fairer word
than fair. I almost wish we were butterflies
and liv’d but three summer days—three
such days with you I could fill
with more delight than fifty common
years could ever contain. But however
selfish I may feel, I am sure I could
never act selfishly: as I told you a day
or two before I left Hampstead, I will
never return to London if my Fate does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
not turn up Pam<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> or at least a Court-card.
Though I could centre my Happiness
in you, I cannot expect to engross your
heart so entirely—indeed if I thought
you felt as much for me as I do for you
at this moment I do not think I could
restrain myself from seeing you again
tomorrow for the delight of one
embrace. But no—I must live upon
hope and Chance. In case of the worst
that can happen, I shall still love you—but
what hatred shall I have for another!
Some lines I read the other day are
continually ringing a peal in my ears:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

curse myself for having sent you so cold

<p class="noindent">My sweet Girl,</p>

<p>Your Letter gave me more
delight than any thing in the world but
yourself could do; indeed I am almost
astonished that any absent one should
have that luxurious power over my
senses which I feel. Even when I am
not thinking of you I receive your
influence and a tenderer nature stealing
upon me. All my thoughts, my unhappiest
days and nights, have I find
not at all cured me of my love of
Beauty, but made it so intense that I
am miserable that you are not with me:
or rather breathe in that dull sort of
patience that cannot be called Life. I
never knew before, what such a love as
you have made me feel, was; I did not
believe in it; my Fancy was afraid of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lest it should burn me up. But if you
will fully love me, though there may be
some fire, ’twill not be more than we can
bear when moistened and bedewed with
Pleasures. You mention ‘horrid people’
and ask me whether it depend upon
them whether I see you again. Do
understand me, my love, in this. I have
so much of you in my heart that I
must turn Mentor when I see a chance
of harm befalling you. I would never
see any thing but Pleasure in your eyes,
love on your lips, and Happiness in your
steps. I would wish to see you among
those amusements suitable to your
inclinations and spirits; so that our
loves might be a delight in the midst
of Pleasures agreeable enough, rather
than a resource from vexations and
cares. But I doubt much, in case of
the worst, whether I shall be philosopher
enough to follow my own Lessons: if I
saw my resolution give you a pain I
could not. Why may I not speak of
your Beauty, since without that I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
never have lov’d you?—I cannot conceive
any beginning of such love as I
have for you but Beauty. There may
be a sort of love for which, without the
least sneer at it, I have the highest
respect and can admire it in others:
but it has not the richness, the bloom,
the full form, the enchantment of love
after my own heart. So let me speak
of your Beauty, though to my own
endangering; if you could be so cruel
to me as to try elsewhere its Power.
You say you are afraid I shall think
you do not love me—in saying this you
make me ache the more to be near you.
I am at the diligent use of my faculties
here, I do not pass a day without
sprawling some blank verse or tagging
some rhymes; and here I must confess,
that (since I am on that subject) I love
you the more in that I believe you
have liked me for my own sake and for
nothing else. I have met with women
whom I really think would like to be
married to a Poem and to be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
away by a Novel. I have seen your
Comet, and only wish it was a sign that
poor Rice would get well whose illness
makes him rather a melancholy companion:
and the more so as so to
conquer his feelings and hide them
from me, with a forc’d Pun. I kiss’d
your writing over in the hope you
had indulg’d me by leaving a trace of
honey. What was your dream? Tell
it me and I will tell you the interpretation
thereof.</p>

<p class="noindent">My sweet Girl,</p>

<p>I hope you did not blame me
much for not obeying your request of a
Letter on Saturday: we have had four in
our small room playing at cards night
and morning leaving me no undisturb’d
opportunity to write. Now Rice and
Martin are gone I am at liberty. Brown
to my sorrow confirms the account you
give of your ill health. You cannot
conceive how I ache to be with you:
how I would die for one hour——for
what is in the world? I say you cannot
conceive; it is impossible you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
look with such eyes upon me as I have
upon you: it cannot be. Forgive me if
I wander a little this evening, for I
have been all day employ’d in a very
abstract Poem and I am in deep love
with you—two things which must
excuse me. I have, believe me, not
been an age in letting you take possession
of me; the very first week I knew
you I wrote myself your vassal; but
burnt the Letter as the very next time
I saw you I thought you manifested
some dislike to me. If you should ever
feel for Man at the first sight what I did
for you, I am lost. Yet I should not
quarrel with you, but hate myself if
such a thing were to happen—only I
should burst if the thing were not as
fine as a Man as you are as a Woman.
Perhaps I am too vehement, then fancy
me on my knees, especially when I
mention a part of your Letter which
hurt me; you say speaking of Mr.
Severn “but you must be satisfied in
knowing that I admired you much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
than your friend.” My dear love, I
cannot believe there ever was or ever
could be any thing to admire in me
especially as far as sight goes—I cannot
be admired, I am not a thing to be
admired. You are, I love you; all I
can bring you is a swooning admiration
of your Beauty. I hold that place
among Men which snub-nos’d brunettes
with meeting eyebrows do among
women—they are trash to me—unless
I should find one among them with a
fire in her heart like the one that burns
in mine. You absorb me in spite of
myself—you alone: for I look not
forward with any pleasure to what is
call’d being settled in the world; I
tremble at domestic cares—yet for you
I would meet them, though if it would
leave you the happier I would rather
die than do so. I have two luxuries to
brood over in my walks, your Loveliness
and the hour of my death. O that I
could have possession of them both in
the same minute. I hate the world: it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
batters too much the wings of my self-will,
and would I could take a sweet
poison from your lips to send me out of
it. From no others would I take it. I
am indeed astonish’d to find myself so
careless of all charms but yours—remembering
as I do the time when
even a bit of ribband was a matter of
interest with me. What softer words
can I find for you after this—what it is
I will not read. Nor will I say more
here, but in a Postscript answer any
thing else you may have mentioned in
your Letter in so many words—for I am
distracted with a thousand thoughts. I
will imagine you Venus tonight and
pray, pray, pray to your star like a
Heathen.</p>

<p class="right">Shanklin, Thursday Night.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Postmark,</i> Newport, 9 August, 1819.]</p>

<p class="noindent">My dear Girl,</p>

<p>You say you must not have any
more such Letters as the last: I’ll try
that you shall not by running obstinate
the other way. Indeed I have not fair
play—I am not idle enough for proper
downright love-letters—I leave this
minute a scene in our Tragedy<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
see you (think it not blasphemy) through
the mist of Plots, speeches, counterplots
and counterspeeches. The Lover
is madder than I am—I am nothing to
him—he has a figure like the Statue of
Meleager and double distilled fire in
his heart. Thank God for my diligence!
were it not for that I should
be miserable. I encourage it, and strive
not to think of you—but when I have
succeeded in doing so all day and as
far as midnight, you return, as soon as
this artificial excitement goes off, more
severely from the fever I am left in.
Upon my soul I cannot say what you
could like me for. I do not think
myself a fright any more than I do
Mr. A., Mr. B., and Mr. C.—yet if I
were a woman I should not like A. B.
C. But enough of this. So you intend
to hold me to my promise of seeing
you in a short time. I shall keep it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with as much sorrow as gladness: for
I am not one of the Paladins of old
who liv’d upon water grass and smiles
for years together. What though would
I not give tonight for the gratification
of my eyes alone? This day week we
shall move to Winchester; for I feel
the want of a Library.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Brown will
leave me there to pay a visit to Mr.
Snook at Bedhampton: in his absence
I will flit to you and back. I will stay
very little while, for as I am in a train
of writing now I fear to disturb it—let
it have its course bad or good—in it I
shall try my own strength and the
public pulse. At Winchester I shall
get your Letters more readily; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
being a cathedral City I shall have a
pleasure always a great one to me
when near a Cathedral, of reading them
during the service up and down the
Aisle.</p>

<p><i>Friday Morning.</i>—Just as I had written
thus far last night, Brown came down
in his morning coat and nightcap,
saying he had been refresh’d by a good
sleep and was very hungry. I left him
eating and went to bed, being too tired
to enter into any discussions. You
would delight very greatly in the walks
about here; the Cliffs, woods, hills,
sands, rocks &amp;c. about here. They
are however not so fine but I shall give
them a hearty good bye to exchange
them for my Cathedral.—Yet again I
am not so tired of Scenery as to hate
Switzerland. We might spend a pleasant
year at Berne or Zurich—if it
should please Venus to hear my “Beseech
thee to hear us O Goddess.”
And if she should hear, God forbid we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
should what people call, <em>settle</em>—turn
into a pond, a stagnant Lethe—a vile
crescent, row or buildings. Better be
imprudent moveables than prudent fixtures.
Open my Mouth at the Street
door like the Lion’s head at Venice to
receive hateful cards, letters, messages.
Go out and wither at tea parties; freeze
at dinners; bake at dances; simmer at
routs. No my love, trust yourself to
me and I will find you nobler amusements,
fortune favouring. I fear you
will not receive this till Sunday or
Monday: as the Irishman would write
do not in the mean while hate me. I
long to be off for Winchester, for I
begin to dislike the very door-posts here—the
names, the pebbles. You ask
after my health, not telling me whether
you are better. I am quite well. You
going out is no proof that you are:
how is it? Late hours will do you
great harm. What fairing is it? I
was alone for a couple of days while
Brown went gadding over the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with his ancient knapsack. Now I like
his society as well as any Man’s, yet
regretted his return—it broke in upon
me like a Thunderbolt. I had got in
a dream among my Books—really luxuriating
in a solitude and silence you
alone should have disturb’d.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Postmark</i>, 16 August, 1819.]</p>

<p>My dear Girl—what shall I say for
myself? I have been here four days
and not yet written you—’tis true I
have had many teasing letters of business
to dismiss—and I have been in the
Claws, like a serpent in an Eagle’s, of
the last act of our Tragedy. This is
no excuse; I know it; I do not presume
to offer it. I have no right either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to ask a speedy answer to let me know
how lenient you are—I must remain
some days in a Mist—I see you through
a Mist: as I daresay you do me by this
time. Believe in the first Letters I
wrote you: I assure you I felt as I
wrote—I could not write so now. The
thousand images I have had pass
through my brain—my uneasy spirits—my
unguess’d fate—all spread as a
veil between me and you. Remember
I have had no idle leisure to brood
over you—’tis well perhaps I have
not. I could not have endured the
throng of jealousies that used to haunt
me before I had plunged so deeply into
imaginary interests. I would fain, as
my sails are set, sail on without an interruption
for a Brace of Months longer—I
am in complete cue—in the fever;
and shall in these four Months do an
immense deal. This Page as my eye
skims over it I see is excessively unloverlike
and ungallant—I cannot help
it—I am no officer in yawning quarters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
no Parson-Romeo. My Mind is
heap’d to the full; stuff’d like a cricket
ball—if I strive to fill it more it would
burst. I know the generality of women
would hate me for this; that I
should have so unsoften’d, so hard a
Mind as to forget them; forget the
brightest realities for the dull imaginations
of my own Brain. But I conjure
you to give it a fair thinking; and ask
yourself whether ’tis not better to explain
my feelings to you, than write
artificial Passion.—Besides, you would
see through it. It would be vain to
strive to deceive you. ’Tis harsh,
harsh, I know it. My heart seems now
made of iron—I could not write a
proper answer to an invitation to Idalia.
You are my Judge: my forehead is on
the ground. You seem offended at a
little simple innocent childish playfulness
in my last. I did not seriously
mean to say that you were endeavouring
to make me keep my promise. I
beg your pardon for it. ’Tis but <em>just</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
your Pride should take the alarm—<em>seriously</em>.
You say I may do as I
please—I do not think with any conscience
I can; my cash resources are
for the present stopp’d; I fear for some
time. I spend no money, but it increases
my debts. I have all my life
thought very little of these matters—they
seem not to belong to me. It may
be a proud sentence; but by Heaven
I am as entirely above all matters of
interest as the Sun is above the Earth—and
though of my own money I
should be careless; of my Friends’ I
must be spare. You see how I go on—like
so many strokes of a hammer. I
cannot help it—I am impell’d, driven
to it. I am not happy enough for
silken Phrases, and silver sentences. I
can no more use soothing words to you
than if I were at this moment engaged
in a charge of Cavalry. Then you will
say I should not write at all.—Should
I not? This Winchester is a fine place:
a beautiful Cathedral and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ancient buildings in the Environs. The
little coffin of a room at Shanklin is
changed for a large room, where I can
promenade at my pleasure—looks out
onto a beautiful—blank side of a house.
It is strange I should like it better
than the view of the sea from our window
at Shanklin. I began to hate the
very posts there—the voice of the old
Lady over the way was getting a great
Plague. The Fisherman’s face never
altered any more than our black teapot—the
knob however was knock’d
off to my little relief. I am getting a
great dislike of the picturesque; and
can only relish it over again by seeing
you enjoy it. One of the pleasantest
things I have seen lately was at Cowes.
The Regent in his Yatch<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> (I think they
spell it) was anchored opposite—a
beautiful vessel—and all the Yatchs <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>and
boats on the coast were passing
and repassing it; and circuiting and
tacking about it in every direction—I
never beheld anything so silent, light,
and graceful.—As we pass’d over to
Southampton, there was nearly an accident.
There came by a Boat well
mann’d, with two naval officers at the
stern. Our Bow-lines took the top of
their little mast and snapped it off close
by the board. Had the mast been a
little stouter they would have been upset.
In so trifling an event I could not
help admiring our seamen—neither
officer nor man in the whole Boat
moved a muscle—they scarcely notic’d
it even with words. Forgive me
for this flint-worded Letter, and believe
and see that I cannot think of you
without some sort of energy—though
mal à propos. Even as I leave off it
seems to me that a few more moments’
thought of you would uncrystallize and
dissolve me. I must not give way to it—but
turn to my writing again—if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fail I shall die hard. O my love, your
lips are growing sweet again to my
fancy—I must forget them. Ever your

<p>I have been hurried to town
by a Letter from my brother George; it
is not of the brightest intelligence. Am
I mad or not? I came by the Friday
night coach and have not yet been to
Hampstead. Upon my soul it is not
my fault. I cannot resolve to mix any
pleasure with my days: they go one like
another, undistinguishable. If I were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to see you today it would destroy the
half comfortable sullenness I enjoy at
present into downright perplexities. I
love you too much to venture to Hampstead,
I feel it is not paying a visit,
but venturing into a fire. <i>Que feraije?</i>
as the French novel writers say in fun,
and I in earnest: really what can I do?
Knowing well that my life must be
passed in fatigue and trouble, I have
been endeavouring to wean myself from
you: for to myself alone what can be
much of a misery? As far as they
regard myself I can despise all events:
but I cannot cease to love you. This

that seemingly true story against me
last night, I felt it would be death to
me if you had ever believed it—though
against any one else I could muster up
my obstinacy. Before I knew Brown
could disprove it I was for the moment
miserable. When shall we pass a day
alone? I have had a thousand kisses,
for which with my whole soul I thank
love—but if you should deny me the
thousand and first—’twould put me to
the proof how great a misery I could
live through. If you should ever carry
your threat yesterday into execution—believe
me ’tis not my pride, my vanity

<p>This moment I have set myself
to copy some verses out fair. I cannot
proceed with any degree of content. I
must write you a line or two and see if
that will assist in dismissing you from
my Mind for ever so short a time. Upon
my Soul I can think of nothing else.
The time is passed when I had power
to advise and warn you against the
unpromising morning of my Life. My
love has made me selfish. I cannot
exist without you. I am forgetful of
everything but seeing you again—my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Life seems to stop there—I see no
further. You have absorb’d me. I
have a sensation at the present moment
as though I was dissolving—I should
be exquisitely miserable without the
hope of soon seeing you. I should be
afraid to separate myself far from you.
My sweet Fanny, will your heart never
change? My love, will it? I have no
limit now to my love.... Your note
came in just here. I cannot be happier
away from you. ’Tis richer than an
Argosy of Pearles. Do not threat me
even in jest. I have been astonished
that Men could die Martyrs for religion—I
have shudder’d at it. I shudder
no more—I could be martyr’d for my
Religion—Love is my religion—I could
die for that. I could die for you. My
Creed is Love and you are its only tenet.
You have ravish’d me away by a Power
I cannot resist; and yet I could resist
till I saw you; and even since I have
seen you I have endeavoured often “to
reason against the reasons of my Love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>”
I can do that no more—the pain would
be too great. My love is selfish. I

<p>If illness makes such an agreeable
variety in the manner of your eyes
I should wish you sometimes to be ill.
I wish I had read your note before
you went last night that I might have
assured you how far I was from suspecting
any coldness. You had a just
right to be a little silent to one who
speaks so plainly to you. You must
believe—you shall, you will—that I can
do nothing, say nothing, think nothing
of you but what has its spring in the
Love which has so long been my pleasure
and torment. On the night I was
taken ill—when so violent a rush of
blood came to my Lungs that I felt
nearly suffocated—I assure you I felt
it possible I might not survive, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that moment thought of nothing but
you. When I said to Brown “this is
unfortunate”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> I thought of you. ’Tis
true that since the first two or three

I am recommended not even to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>

<p>My dearest Girl, how could it ever

how could I have said such a thing?
The utmost stretch my mind has been
capable of was to endeavour to forget
you for your own sake seeing what a
chance there was of my remaining in
a precarious state of health. I would
have borne it as I would bear death if
fate was in that humour: but I should
as soon think of choosing to die as to
part from you. Believe too my Love
that our friends think and speak for the
best, and if their best is not our best
it is not their fault. When I am better
I will speak with you at large on these
subjects, if there is any occasion—I
think there is none. I am rather nervous
today perhaps from being a little
recovered and suffering my mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

<p class="noindent">My dearest Fanny,</p>

<p>I read your note in bed last
night, and that might be the reason of
my sleeping so much better. I think
Mr Brown<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is right in supposing you
may stop too long with me, so very
nervous as I am. Send me every evening
a written Good night. If you come
for a few minutes about six it may be
the best time. Should you ever fancy
me too low-spirited I must warn you to
ascribe it to the medicine I am at
present taking which is of a nerve-shaking
nature. I shall impute any
depression I may experience to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
cause. I have been writing with a vile
old pen the whole week, which is excessively
ungallant. The fault is in the
Quill: I have mended it and still it is
very much inclin’d to make blind es.
However these last lines are in a much
better style of penmanship, tho’ a little
disfigured by the smear of black currant
jelly; which has made a little mark on
one of the pages of Brown’s Ben Jonson,
the very best book he has. I have
lick’d it but it remains very purple. I
did not know whether to say purple or
blue so in the mixture of the thought
wrote purplue which may be an excellent
name for a colour made up of those
two, and would suit well to start next
spring. Be very careful of open doors
and windows and going without your
duffle grey. God bless you Love!</p>

For some reason or other your last

former ones. I would fain that you
call me <em>Love</em> still. To see you happy
and in high spirits is a great consolation
to me—still let me believe that
you are not half so happy as my
restoration would make you. I am
nervous, I own, and may think myself
worse than I really am; if so you must
indulge me, and pamper with that sort
of tenderness you have manifested towards
me in different Letters. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sweet creature when I look back upon
the pains and torments I have suffer’d
for you from the day I left you to go
to the Isle of Wight; the ecstasies in
which I have pass’d some days and the
miseries in their turn, I wonder the
more at the Beauty which has kept up
the spell so fervently. When I send
this round I shall be in the front parlour
watching to see you show yourself
for a minute in the garden. How illness
stands as a barrier betwixt me
and you! Even if I was well——I
must make myself as good a Philosopher
as possible. Now I have had
opportunities of passing nights anxious
and awake I have found other thoughts
intrude upon me. “If I should die,”
said I to myself, “I have left no immortal
work behind me—nothing to
make my friends proud of my memory—but
I have lov’d the principle of
beauty in all things, and if I had had
time I would have made myself remember’d.”
Thoughts like these came very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
feebly whilst I was in health and every
pulse beat for you—now you divide
with this (may <em>I</em> say it?) “last infirmity

my long separation from you. God

way—even my jealousies have been

Can I help it? You are always new.
The last of your kisses was ever the

the last movement the gracefullest.
When you pass’d my window home
yesterday, I was fill’d with as much
admiration as if I had then seen you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

complaint once that I only lov’d your
beauty. Have I nothing else then to
love in you but that? Do not I see a
heart naturally furnish’d with wings
imprison itself with me? No ill
prospect has been able to turn your
thoughts a moment from me. This
perhaps should be as much a subject
of sorrow as joy—but I will not talk of
that. Even if you did not love me I
could not help an entire devotion to
you: how much more deeply then must
I feel for you knowing you love me.
My Mind has been the most discontented
and restless one that ever
was put into a body too small for it. I
never felt my Mind repose upon anything
with complete and undistracted
enjoyment—upon no person but you.
When you are in the room my thoughts

<p>I had a better night last night
than I have had since my attack, and
this morning I am the same as when
you saw me. I have been turning over
two volumes of Letters written between
Rousseau and two Ladies in the perplexed
strain of mingled finesse and
sentiment in which the Ladies and
gentlemen of those days were so clever,
and which is still prevalent among
Ladies of this Country who live in a
state of reasoning romance. The likeness
however only extends to the
mannerism, not to the dexterity. What
would Rousseau have said at seeing our
little correspondence! What would his
Ladies have said! I don’t care much—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
would sooner have Shakspeare’s
opinion about the matter. The common
gossiping of washerwomen must
be less disgusting than the continual
and eternal fence and attack of Rousseau
and these sublime Petticoats.
One calls herself Clara and her friend
Julia, two of Rousseau’s heroines—they
all [<i>sic</i>, but qy. <i>at</i>] the same time
christen poor Jean Jacques St. Preux—who
is the pure cavalier of his famous
novel. Thank God I am born in England

to the cold. There’s the Thrush
again—I can’t afford it—he’ll run me
up a pretty Bill for Music—besides he
ought to know I deal at Clementi’s.
How can you bear so long an imprisonment
at Hampstead? I shall always
remember it with all the gusto that a
monopolizing carle should. I could
build an Altar to you for it.</p>

<p>As, from the last part of my
note you must see how gratified I have
been by your remaining at home, you
might perhaps conceive that I was
equally bias’d the other way by your
going to Town, I cannot be easy tonight
without telling you you would be

<p>In consequence of our company
I suppose I shall not see you before
tomorrow. I am much better today—indeed
all I have to complain of is
want of strength and a little tightness
in the Chest. I envied Sam’s walk
with you today; which I will not do
again as I may get very tired of envying.
I imagine you now sitting in your
new black dress which I like so much
and if I were a little less selfish and
more enthusiastic I should run round
and surprise you with a knock at the
door. I fear I am too prudent for a
dying kind of Lover. Yet, there is a
great difference between going off in
warm blood like Romeo, and making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
one’s exit like a frog in a frost. I had
nothing particular to say today, but
not intending that there shall be any
interruption to our correspondence
(which at some future time I propose
offering to Murray) I write something.
God bless you my sweet Love! Illness
is a long lane, but I see you

<p class="noindent">Dear Girl,</p>

<p>Yesterday you must have thought
me worse than I really was. I assure
you there was nothing but regret at
being obliged to forego an embrace
which has so many times been the
highest gust of my Life. I would not
care for health without it. Sam would
not come in—I wanted merely to
ask him how you were this morning.
When one is not quite well we turn for
relief to those we love: this is no weakness
of spirit in me: you know when in
health I thought of nothing but you;
when I shall again be so it will be the
same. Brown has been mentioning to
me that some hint from Sam, last night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
occasions him some uneasiness. He
whispered something to you concerning
Brown and old Mr. Dilke<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which had
the complexion of being something
derogatory to the former. It was
connected with an anxiety about Mr.
D. Sr’s death and an anxiety to set out
for Chichester. These sort of hints
point out their own solution: one
cannot pretend to a delicate ignorance
on the subject: you understand the
whole matter. If any one, my sweet
Love, has misrepresented, to you, to
your Mother or Sam, any circumstances
which are at all likely, at a
tenth remove, to create suspicions
among people who from their own
interested notions slander others, pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
tell me: for I feel the least attaint on
the disinterested character of Brown
very deeply. Perhaps Reynolds or
some other of my friends may come
towards evening, therefore you may
choose whether you will come to see
me early today before or after dinner
as you may think fit. Remember me
to your Mother and tell her to drag
you to me if you show the least
reluctance—</p>

<p class="right">Wednesday Morning.</p>

<p class="noindent">My dearest Fanny,</p>

<p>I have been a walk this morning
with a book in my hand, but as usual I
have been occupied with nothing but
you: I wish I could say in an agreeable
manner. I am tormented day and
night. They talk of my going to Italy.
’Tis certain I shall never recover if I am
to be so long separate from you: yet with
all this devotion to you I cannot persuade
myself into any confidence of
you. Past experience connected with
the fact of my long separation from
you gives me agonies which are scarcely
to be talked of. When your mother
comes I shall be very sudden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
expert in asking her whether you have
been to Mrs. Dilke’s, for she might say
no to make me easy. I am literally
worn to death, which seems my only
recourse. I cannot forget what has
pass’d. What? nothing with a man of
the world, but to me deathful. I will
get rid of this as much as possible.
When you were in the habit of flirting
with Brown you would have left off,
could your own heart have felt one half
of one pang mine did. Brown is a good
sort of Man—he did not know he was
doing me to death by inches. I feel
the effect of every one of those hours
in my side now; and for that cause,
though he has done me many services,
though I know his love and friendship
for me, though at this moment I should
be without pence were it not for his
assistance, I will never see or speak to
him<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> until we are both old men, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
are to be. I <em>will</em> resent my heart
having been made a football. You
will call this madness. I have heard
you say that it was not unpleasant to
wait a few years—you have amusements—your
mind is away—you have
not brooded over one idea as I have,
and how should you? You are to me
an object intensely desirable—the air I
breathe in a room empty of you is
unhealthy. I am not the same to you—no—you
can wait—you have a thousand
activities—you can be happy without
me. Any party, any thing to fill up the
day has been enough. How have you
pass’d this month?<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Who have you
smil’d with? All this may seem savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in me. You do not feel as I do—you
do not know what it is to love—one day
you may—your time is not come. Ask
yourself how many unhappy hours
Keats has caused you in Loneliness.
For myself I have been a Martyr the
whole time, and for this reason I speak;
the confession is forc’d from me by the
torture. I appeal to you by the blood
of that Christ you believe in: Do not
write to me if you have done anything
this month which it would have pained
me to have seen. You may have
altered—if you have not—if you still
behave in dancing rooms and other
societies as I have seen you—I do not
want to live—if you have done so I
wish this coming night may be my last.
I cannot live without you, and not only
you but <em>chaste you</em>; <em>virtuous you</em>. The
Sun rises and sets, the day passes, and
you follow the bent of your inclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to a certain extent—you have no conception
of the quantity of miserable
feeling that passes through me in a
day.—Be serious! Love is not a plaything—and
again do not write unless
you can do it with a crystal conscience.
I would sooner die for want of you
than——</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">My dearest Fanny,</p>

<p>My head is puzzled this morning,
and I scarce know what I shall say
though I am full of a hundred things.
’Tis certain I would rather be writing to
you this morning, notwithstanding the
alloy of grief in such an occupation,
than enjoy any other pleasure, with
health to boot, unconnected with you.
Upon my soul I have loved you to the
extreme. I wish you could know the
Tenderness with which I continually
brood over your different aspects of
countenance, action and dress. I see
you come down in the morning: I see
you meet me at the Window—I see
every thing over again eternally that I
ever have seen. If I get on the pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
clue I live in a sort of happy misery, if
on the unpleasant ’tis miserable misery.
You complain of my illtreating you in
word, thought and deed—I am sorry,—at
times I feel bitterly sorry that I ever
made you unhappy—my excuse is that
those words have been wrung from me
by the sharpness of my feelings. At
all events and in any case I have been
wrong; could I believe that I did it
without any cause, I should be the most
sincere of Penitents. I could give way
to my repentant feelings now, I could
recant all my suspicions, I could mingle
with you heart and Soul though absent,
were it not for some parts of your
Letters. Do you suppose it possible I
could ever leave you? You know what
I think of myself and what of you.
You know that I should feel how much
it was my loss and how little yours.
My friends laugh at you! I know
some of them—when I know them all
I shall never think of them again as
friends or even acquaintance. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
friends have behaved well to me in
every instance but one, and there they
have become tattlers, and inquisitors into
my conduct: spying upon a secret I
would rather die than share it with any
body’s confidence. For this I cannot
wish them well, I care not to see any of
them again. If I am the Theme, I
will not be the Friend of idle Gossips.
Good gods what a shame it is our Loves
should be so put into the microscope
of a Coterie. Their laughs should not
affect you (I may perhaps give you
reasons some day for these laughs, for
I suspect a few people to hate me well
enough, <em>for reasons I know of</em>, who have
pretended a great friendship for me)
when in competition with one, who if he
never should see you again would make
you the Saint of his memory. These
Laughers, who do not like you, who
envy you for your Beauty, who would
have God-bless’d me from you for ever:
who were plying me with disencouragements
with respect to you eternally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
People are revengful—do not mind
them—do nothing but love me—if I
knew that for certain life and health
will in such event be a heaven, and
death itself will be less painful. I long
to believe in immortality. I shall never
be able to bid you an entire farewell.
If I am destined to be happy with you
here—how short is the longest Life. I
wish to believe in immortality<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>—I wish
to live with you for ever. Do not let
my name ever pass between you and
those laughers; if I have no other
merit than the great Love for you, that
were sufficient to keep me sacred and
unmentioned in such society. If I have
been cruel and unjust I swear my love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
has ever been greater than my cruelty
which last [<i>sic</i>] but a minute whereas my
Love come what will shall last for ever.
If concession to me has hurt your Pride
God knows I have had little pride in
my heart when thinking of you. Your
name never passes my Lips—do not let
mine pass yours. Those People do not
like me. After reading my Letter you
even then wish to see me. I am strong
enough to walk over—but I dare not.
I shall feel so much pain in parting with
you again. My dearest love, I am
afraid to see you; I am strong, but not
strong enough to see you. Will my
arm be ever round you again, and if so
shall I be obliged to leave you again?
My sweet Love! I am happy whilst
I believe your first Letter. Let me be
but certain that you are mine heart and
soul, and I could die more happily than
I could otherwise live. If you think
me cruel—if you think I have sleighted
you—do muse it over again and see
into my heart. My love to you is “true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as truth’s simplicity and simpler than
the infancy of truth” as I think I once
said before. How could I sleight you?
How threaten to leave you? not in the
spirit of a Threat to you—no—but in
the spirit of Wretchedness in myself.
My fairest, my delicious, my angel
Fanny! do not believe me such a vulgar
fellow. I will be as patient in illness
and as believing in Love as I am able.</p>

<p class="noindent">My dearest Girl,</p>

<p>I wish you could invent some
means to make me at all happy without
you. Every hour I am more and more
concentrated in you; every thing else
tastes like chaff in my Mouth. I feel it
almost impossible to go to Italy—the
fact is I cannot leave you, and shall
never taste one minute’s content until it
pleases chance to let me live with you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
for good. But I will not go on at this
rate. A person in health as you are
can have no conception of the horrors
that nerves and a temper like mine
go through. What Island do your
friends propose retiring to? I should
be happy to go with you there alone,
but in company I should object to it;
the backbitings and jealousies of new
colonists who have nothing else to
amuse themselves, is unbearable. Mr.
Dilke came to see me yesterday, and
gave me a very great deal more pain
than pleasure. I shall never be able
any more to endure the society of any
of those who used to meet at Elm
Cottage and Wentworth Place. The
last two years taste like brass upon my
Palate. If I cannot live with you I
will live alone. I do not think my
health will improve much while I am
separated from you. For all this I am
averse to seeing you—I cannot bear
flashes of light and return into my
gloom again. I am not so unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
now as I should be if I had seen you
yesterday. To be happy with you
seems such an impossibility! it requires
a luckier Star than mine! it will never
be. I enclose a passage from one of
your letters which I want you to alter a
little—I want (if you will have it so)
the matter express’d less coldly to me.
If my health would bear it, I could
write a Poem which I have in my head,
which would be a consolation for people
in such a situation as mine. I would
show some one in Love as I am, with a
person living in such Liberty as you do.
Shakespeare always sums up matters in
the most sovereign manner. Hamlet’s
heart was full of such Misery as mine is
when he said to Ophelia “Go to a
Nunnery, go, go!” Indeed I should like
to give up the matter at once—I should
like to die. I am sickened at the brute
world which you are smiling with. I
hate men, and women more. I see
nothing but thorns for the future—wherever
I may be next winter, in Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
or nowhere, Brown will be living near
you with his indecencies. I see no
prospect of any rest. Suppose me in
Rome—well, I should there see you as in
a magic glass going to and from town at
all hours,——I wish you could
infuse a little confidence of human nature
into my heart. I cannot muster any—the
world is too brutal for me—I am glad
there is such a thing as the grave—I
am sure I shall never have any rest till
I get there. At any rate I will indulge
myself by never seeing any more Dilke
or Brown or any of their Friends. I
wish I was either in your arms full of
faith or that a Thunder bolt would strike
me.</p>

<p class="noindent">My love,</p>

<p>I have been in so irritable a
state of health these two or three last
days, that I did not think I should be
able to write this week. Not that I was
so ill, but so much so as only to be
capable of an unhealthy teasing letter.
To night I am greatly recovered only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
feel the languor I have felt after you
touched with ardency. You say you
perhaps might have made me better:
you would then have made me worse:
now you could quite effect a cure:
What fee my sweet Physician would I
not give you to do so. Do not call it
folly, when I tell you I took your letter
last night to bed with me. In the
morning I found your name on the
sealing wax obliterated. I was startled
at the bad omen till I recollected that
it must have happened in my dreams,
and they you know fall out by contraries.
You must have found out by
this time I am a little given to bode ill
like the raven; it is my misfortune not
my fault; it has proceeded from the
general tenor of the circumstances of
my life, and rendered every event
suspicious. However I will no more
trouble either you or myself with sad
prophecies; though so far I am pleased
at it as it has given me opportunity to
love your disinterestedness towards me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I can be a raven no more; you and
pleasure take possession of me at the
same moment. I am afraid you have
been unwell. If through me illness
have touched you (but it must be with
a very gentle hand) I must be selfish
enough to feel a little glad at it. Will
you forgive me this? I have been
reading lately an oriental tale of a very
beautiful color<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>—It is of a city of melancholy
men, all made so by this circumstance.
Through a series of adventures
each one of them by turns reach some
gardens of Paradise where they meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with a most enchanting Lady; and just
as they are going to embrace her, she
bids them shut their eyes—they shut
them—and on opening their eyes again
find themselves descending to the earth
in a magic basket. The remembrance of
this Lady and their delights lost beyond
all recovery render them melancholy
ever after. How I applied this to you,
my dear; how I palpitated at it; how
the certainty that you were in the same
world with myself, and though as beautiful,
not so talismanic as that Lady; how
I could not bear you should be so you
must believe because I swear it by
yourself. I cannot say when I shall
get a volume ready. I have three or
four stories half done, but as I cannot
write for the mere sake of the press, I
am obliged to let them progress or lie
still as my fancy chooses. By Christmas
perhaps they may appear,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> but I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
not yet sure they ever will. ’Twill be
no matter, for Poems are as common as
newspapers and I do not see why it is a
greater crime in me than in another to
let the verses of an half-fledged brain
tumble into the reading-rooms and
drawing-room windows. Rice has been
better lately than usual: he is not
suffering from any neglect of his parents
who have for some years been able to
appreciate him better than they did in
his first youth, and are now devoted to
his comfort. Tomorrow I shall, if my
health continues to improve during the
night, take a look fa[r]ther about the
country, and spy at the parties about
here who come hunting after the
picturesque like beagles. It is astonishing
how they raven down scenery like
children do sweetmeats. The wondrous
Chine here is a very great Lion: I wish
I had as many guineas as there have
been spy-glasses in it. I have been, I
cannot tell why, in capital spirits this
last hour. What reason? When I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to take my candle and retire to a lonely
room, without the thought as I fall
asleep, of seeing you tomorrow morning?
or the next day, or the next—it
takes on the appearance of impossibility
and eternity—I will say a month—I will
say I will see you in a month at most,
though no one but yourself should see
me; if it be but for an hour. I should
not like to be so near you as London
without being continually with you:
after having once more kissed you
Sweet I would rather be here alone at
my task than in the bustle and hateful
literary chitchat. Meantime you must
write to me—as I will every week—for
your letters keep me alive. My sweet
Girl I cannot speak my love for you.
Good night! and</p>

<p class="noindent">My dearest Girl,</p>

<p>I wrote a letter<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> for you yesterday
expecting to have seen your
mother. I shall be selfish enough to
send it though I know it may give you
a little pain, because I wish you to see
how unhappy I am for love of you,
and endeavour as much as I can to
entice you to give up your whole heart
to me whose whole existence hangs upon
you. You could not step or move an
eyelid but it would shoot to my heart—I
am greedy of you. Do not think of
anything but me. Do not live as if I
was not existing. Do not forget me—But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
have I any right to say you forget
me? Perhaps you think of me all day.
Have I any right to wish you to be unhappy
for me? You would forgive me
for wishing it if you knew the extreme
passion I have that you should love me—and
for you to love me as I do you,
you must think of no one but me, much
less write that sentence. Yesterday and
this morning I have been haunted with
a sweet vision—I have seen you the
whole time in your shepherdess dress.
How my senses have ached at it! How
my heart has been devoted to it! How
my eyes have been full of tears at it!
I[n]deed I think a real love is enough to
occupy the widest heart. Your going
to town alone when I heard of it was a
shock to me—yet I expected it—<em>promise
me you will not for some time
till I get better</em>. Promise me this and
fill the paper full of the most endearing
names. If you cannot do so with good
will, do my love tell me—say what you
think—confess if your heart is too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
fasten’d on the world. Perhaps then I
may see you at a greater distance, I may
not be able to appropriate you so closely
to myself. Were you to loose a
favourite bird from the cage, how would
your eyes ache after it as long as it was
in sight; when out of sight you would
recover a little. Perhaps if you would,
if so it is, confess to me how many
things are necessary to you besides me,
I might be happier; by being less
tantaliz’d. Well may you exclaim,
how selfish, how cruel not to let me
enjoy my youth! to wish me to be unhappy.
You must be so if you love me.
Upon my soul I can be contented with
nothing else. If you would really what
is call’d enjoy yourself at a Party—if
you can smile in people’s faces, and wish
them to admire you <em>now</em>—you never
have nor ever will love me. I see <em>life</em> in
nothing but the certainty of your Love—convince
me of it my sweetest. If I
am not somehow convinced I shall die
of agony. If we love we must not live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
as other men and women do—I cannot
brook the wolfsbane of fashion and
foppery and tattle—you must be mine
to die upon the rack if I want you. I
do not pretend to say that I have more
feeling than my fellows, but I wish you
seriously to look over my letters kind
and unkind and consider whether the
person who wrote them can be able to
endure much longer the agonies and
uncertainties which you are so peculiarly
made to create. My recovery of bodily
health will be of no benefit to me if you
are not mine when I am well. For
God’s sake save me—or tell me my
passion is of too awful a nature for you.
Again God bless you.</p>

<p class="right">J. K.</p>

<p>No—my sweet Fanny—I am wrong—I
do not wish you to be unhappy—and
yet I do, I must while there is so sweet
a Beauty—my loveliest, my darling!
good bye! I kiss you—O the torments!</p>

<h3>I.<br />
<span class="smaller">FANNY BRAWNE’S ESTIMATE OF KEATS.</span></h3>

<p>In discussing the effect which the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
article had on Keats, Medwin<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> quotes the following
passages from a communication addressed to him by
Fanny Brawne after her marriage:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I did not know Keats at the time the review
appeared. It was published, if I remember rightly,
in June, 1818.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> However great his mortification
might have been, he was not, I should say, of a
character likely to have displayed it in the manner
mentioned in Mrs. Shelley’s Remains of her husband.
Keats, soon after the appearance of the review in
question, started on a walking expedition into the
Highlands. From thence he was forced to return, in
consequence of the illness of a brother, whose death
a few months afterwards affected him strongly.</p>

<p>“It was about this time that I became acquainted
with Keats. We met frequently at the house of a
mutual friend, (not Leigh Hunt’s), but neither then
nor afterwards did I see anything in his manner to
give the idea that he was brooding over any secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
grief or disappointment. His conversation was in the
highest degree interesting, and his spirits good,
excepting at moments when anxiety regarding his
brother’s health dejected them. His own illness,
that commenced in January 1820,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> began from inflammation
in the lungs, from cold. In coughing, he
ruptured a blood-vessel. An hereditary tendency to
consumption was aggravated by the excessive susceptibility
of his temperament, for I never see those often
quoted lines of Dryden without thinking how exactly
they applied to Keats:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The fiery soul, that working out its way,</div>
<div class="verse">Fretted the pigmy body to decay.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">From the commencement of his malady he was forbidden
to write a line of poetry,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and his failing
health, joined to the uncertainty of his prospects,
often threw him into deep melancholy.</p>

<p>“The letter, p. 295 of Shelley’s Remains, from Mr.
Finch, seems calculated to give a very false idea of
Keats. That his sensibility was most acute, is true,
and his passions were very strong, but not violent, if
by that term violence of temper is implied. His was
no doubt susceptible, but his anger seemed rather to
turn on himself than on others, and in moments of
greatest irritation, it was only by a sort of savage
despondency that he sometimes grieved and wounded
his friends. Violence such as the letter describes, was
quite foreign to his nature. For more than a twelvemonth
before quitting England, I saw him every day,
often witnessed his sufferings, both mental and bodily,
and I do not hesitate to say that he never could have
addressed an unkind expression, much less a violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
one, to any human being. During the last few
months before leaving his native country, his mind
underwent a fierce conflict; for whatever in moments
of grief or disappointment he might say or think, his
most ardent desire was to live to redeem his name
from the obloquy cast upon it;<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> nor was it till he knew
his death inevitable, that he eagerly wished to die.
Mr. Finch’s letter goes on to say—‘Keats might be
judged insane,’—I believe the fever that consumed
him, might have brought on a temporary species of
delirium that made his friend Mr. Severn’s task a
painful one.”</p>

<h3>II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LOCALITY OF WENTWORTH PLACE.</span></h3>

<p>The precise locality of Wentworth Place, Hampstead,
has been a matter of uncertainty and dispute; and I
found even the children of the lady to whom the foregoing
letters were addressed without any exact knowledge
on the subject. The houses which went to make
up Wentworth Place were those inhabited respectively
by the Dilke family, the Brawne family, and Charles
Armitage Brown; but these were not three houses as
might be supposed, the fact being that Mrs. Brawne
rented first Brown’s house during his absence with
Keats in the summer of 1818, and then Dilke’s when
the latter removed to Westminster.</p>

<p>At page 98 of the late Mr. Howitt’s <cite>Northern Heights
of London</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> it is said of Keats:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“From this time till 1820, when he left—in the last
stage of consumption—for Italy, he resided principally
at Hampstead. During most of this time, he lived
with his very dear friend Mr. Charles Brown, a Russia
merchant, at Wentworth Place, Downshire Hill, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Pond Street, Hampstead. Previously, he and his
brother Thomas had occupied apartments at the next
house to Mr. Brown’s, at a Mrs. ——’s whose name
his biographers have carefully omitted. With the
daughter of this lady Keats was deeply in love—a
passion which deepened to the last.”</p>

</div>

<p>No authority is given for the statement that John
and Tom Keats lodged with the mother of the lady to
whom John was attached; and I think it must have
arisen from a misapprehension of something communicated
to Mr. Howitt, perhaps in such ambiguous
terms as every investigator has experienced in his time.
At all events I must contradict the statement positively;
nor is there any doubt where the brothers did
lodge, namely in Well Walk, with the family of the local
postman, Benjamin Bentley. Charles Cowden Clarke
mentions in his Recollections that the lodging was “in
the first or second house on the right hand, going up to
the Heath”; and the rate books show that Bentley
was rated from 1814 to 1824 for the house which, in
1838, was numbered 1, the house next to the public
house formerly called the “Green Man,” but now
known as the “Wells” Tavern. At page 102, Mr.
Howitt says:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is to be regretted that Wentworth Place, where
Keats lodged, and wrote some of his finest poetry,
either no longer exists or no longer bears that name.
At the bottom of John Street, on the left hand in descending,
is a villa called Wentworth House; but no
Wentworth Place exists between Downshire Hill and
Pond Street, the locality assigned to it. I made the
most rigorous search in that quarter, inquiring of the
tradesmen daily supplying the houses there, and of two
residents of forty and fifty years. None of them had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
any knowledge or recollection of a Wentworth Place.
Possibly Keats’s friend, Mr. Brown, lived at Wentworth
House, and that the three cottages standing
in a line with it and facing South-End Road, but
at a little distance from the road in a garden,
might then bear the name of Wentworth Place. The
end cottage would then, as stated in the lines of Keats,
be next door to Mr. Brown’s. These cottages still
have apartments to let, and in all other respects accord
with the assigned locality.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Howitt seems to have meant that Wentworth
House <em>with</em> the cottages may possibly have borne the
name of Wentworth Place; and he should have said
that the house was on the <em>right</em> hand in descending
John Street. But the fact of the case is correctly
stated in Mr. Thorne’s <cite>Handbook to the Environs of
London</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Part I, page 291, where a bolder and more
explicit localization is given:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The House in which he [Keats] lodged for the
greater part of the time, then called Wentworth Place,
is now called Lawn Bank, and is the end house but
one on the rt. side of John Street, next Wentworth
House.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Thorne adduces no authority for the statement;
and it must be assumed that it is based on some of
the private communications which he acknowledges
generally in his preface. He may possibly have been
biassed by the plane-tree which Mr. Howitt, at page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
101 of <cite>Northern Heights</cite>, substitutes for the traditional
plum-tree in quoting Lord Houghton’s account of the
composition of the <cite>Ode to a Nightingale</cite>. Certainly
there is a fine old plane-tree in front of the house at
Lawn Bank; and there is a local tradition of a
nightingale and a poet connected with that tree; but
this dim tradition may be merely a misty repetition,
from mouth to mouth, of Mr. Howitt’s extract from
Lord Houghton’s volumes. <i>Primâ facie</i>, a plane-tree
might seem to be a very much more likely shelter
than a plum-tree for Keats to have chosen to place
his chair beneath; and yet one would think that, had
Mr. Howitt purposely substituted the plane-tree for
the plum-tree, it would have been because he found it
by the house which he supposed to be Brown’s. This
however is not the case; and it should also be
mentioned that at the western end of Lawn Bank,
among some shrubs &amp;c., there is an old and dilapidated
plum-tree which grows so as to form a kind of
leafy roof.</p>

<p>Eleven years ago, when I attempted to identify
Wentworth Place beyond a doubt by local and other
enquiries, the gardener at Wentworth House assured
me very positively that, some fifteen or twenty years
before, when Lawn Bank (then called Lawn Cottage)
was in bad repair, and the rain had washed nearly all
the colour off the front, he used to read the words
“Wentworth Place,” painted in large letters beside
the top window at the extreme left of the old part of
the house as one faces it; and I have since had the
pleasure of reading the words there myself; for the
colour got washed thin enough again some time afterwards.
After a great deal of enquiry among older
inhabitants of Hampstead than this gardener, I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a musician, born there in 1801, and resident there
ever since, a most intelligent and clear-headed man,
who had been in the habit of playing at various houses
in Hampstead from the year 1812 onwards. When
asked, simply and without any “leading” remark,
what he could tell about a group of houses formerly
known as Wentworth Place, he replied without hesitation
that Lawn Bank, when he was a youth,
certainly bore that name, that it was two houses, with
entrances at the sides, in one of which he played as
early as 1824, and that subsequently the two houses
were converted into one, at very great expense, to
form a residence for Miss Chester,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> who called the
place Lawn Cottage. This informant did not remember
the names of the persons occupying the two
houses. A surgeon of repute, among the oldest inhabitants
of Hampstead, told me, as an absolute
certainty, that he was there as early as 1827, knew the
Brawne family, and attended them professionally at
Wentworth Place, in the house forming the western
half of Lawn Bank. Of Charles Brown, however,
this gentleman had no knowledge.</p>

<p>Not perfectly satisfied with the local evidence, I
forwarded to Mr. Severn a sketch-plan of the immediate
locality, in order that he might identify the
houses in which he visited Keats and Brown and the
Brawne family: he replied that it was in Lawn Bank
that Brown and Mrs. Brawne had their respective
residences; and he also mentioned side entrances;
but Sir Charles Dilke says his grandfather’s house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
had the entrance in front, and only Brown’s had a
side entrance. Two relatives of Mrs. Brawne’s who
were still living in 1877, and were formerly residents
in the house, also identified this block as that in
which she resided, and so did the late Mr. William
Dilke of Chichester, by whose instructions, during the
absence of his brother, the name was first painted
upon the house. It is hard to see what further
evidence can be wanted on the subject. The recollection
of one person may readily be distrusted; but
where so many memories converge in one result, their
evidence must be accepted; and I leave these details
on record here, mainly on the ground that doubts may
possibly arise again. At present it does not seem as
if there could be any possible question that, in Lawn
Bank, we have the immortalized Wentworth Place
where Keats spent so much time, first as co-inmate
with Brown in the eastern half of the block, and at
last when he went to be nursed by Mrs. and Miss
Brawne in the western half.</p>

<p>It should perhaps be pointed out, in regard to Mr.
Thorne’s expression that Keats <em>lodged</em> there, that this
was not a case of lodging in the ordinary sense: he was
a sharing inmate; and his share of the expenses was
duly acquitted, as recorded by Mr. Dilke. In the
hope of identifying the houses by some documentary
evidence, I had the parish rate-books searched; in
these there is no mention of John Street; but that
part of Hampstead is described as the Lower Heath
Quarter: no names of houses are given; and the only
evidence to the purpose is that, among the ratepayers
of the Lower Heath Quarter, very few in
number, were Charles Wentworth Dilk (without the
final <i>e</i>) and Charles Brown. The name of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Brawne does not appear; but, as she rented the house
in Wentworth Place of Mr. Dilke, it may perhaps be
assumed that it was he who paid the rates.</p>

<p>It will perhaps be thought that the steps of the
enquiry in this matter are somewhat “prolixly set
forth”; and the only plea in mitigation to be offered
is that, without evidence, those who really care to
know the facts of the case could hardly be satisfied.</p>

Great</cite>, which was composed jointly by Keats and
his friend Charles Armitage Brown. For the first
four acts Brown provided the characters, plot, &amp;c.,
and Keats found the language; but the fifth act is
wholly Keats’s. See Lord Houghton’s <cite>Life, Letters,
&amp;c.</cite> (1848), Vol. II, pp. 1 and 2, and foot-note at
p. 333 of the Aldine edition of Keats’s Poetical Works
(Bell &amp; Sons, 1876). A humorous account of the
progress of the joint composition occurs in a letter
written by Brown to Dilke, which is quoted at p. 9
of the memoir prefixed by Sir Charles Dilke to <cite>The
Papers of a Critic</cite>, referred to in the Introduction
to the present volume, <a href="#Page_lviii">p. lviii</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The discrepancy between the date written by
Keats and that given in the postmark is curious as
a comment on his statement (<cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite>, 1848,
Vol. I, p. 253) that he never knew the date: “It
is some days since I wrote the last page, but I never
know....”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Whether he carried out this intention to the
letter, I know not; but he would seem to have been
at Winchester again, at all events, by the 22nd of
September, on which day he was writing thence to
Reynolds (<cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite>, Vol. II, p. 23).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> It would seem to have been in this street that Mr.

asked him to find in the letter of the 1st of October,
from Winchester, given at p. 16, Vol. II, of the
<cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite> (1848). How long Keats remained
in those rooms I have been unable to determine, to
a day; but in Letter No. IX he writes, eight days
later, from Great Smith Street (the address of Mr.
Dilke) that he purposes “living at Hampstead”;
and there is a letter headed “Wentworth Place,
Hampstead, 17th Nov. [1819.]” at p. 35, Vol. II,
of the <cite>Life, Letters, &amp;c.</cite></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> It may be that consideration for his correspondent
induced this moderation of speech: presumably the
scene here referred to is that so graphically given in
Lord Houghton’s <cite>Life</cite> (Vol. II, pp. 53-4), where
we read, not that he merely “felt it possible” he
“might not survive,” but that he said to his friend,
“I know the colour of that blood,—it is arterial
blood—I cannot be deceived in that colour; that
drop is my death-warrant. I must die.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> This coupling of Brown’s name with ideas of

faint indication of a painful phase of feeling more
fully developed in the sequel. See Letters <a href="#LETTER_XXI">XXI</a>,

<em>but</em> indicates that the absence of Brown was still,
as was natural, more or less a condition of the presence
of Miss Brawne. That Keats had, however,
or thought he had, some reason for this condition,
beyond the mere delicacy of lovers, is dimly shadowed
by the cold <i>My dear Fanny</i> with which in <a href="#LETTER_XXI">Letter
XXI</a> the condition was first expressly prescribed, and
more than shadowed by the agonized expression of a
morbid sensibility in Letters <a href="#LETTER_XXXV">XXXV</a> and <a href="#LETTER_XXXVII">XXXVII</a>.
Probably a man in sound health would have found
the cause trivial enough.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> This statement and a general similarity of tone
induce the belief that this letter and the preceding
one were written about the same time as one to Mr.
Dilke, given by Lord Houghton (in the <cite>Life, Letters,
&amp;c.</cite>, Vol. II, p. 57), as bearing the postmark, “Hampstead,
March 4, 1820.” In that letter Keats cites his
friend Brown as having said that he had “picked
up a little flesh,” and he refers to his “being under
an interdict with respect to animal food, living upon
pseudo-victuals,”—just as in <a href="#LETTER_XXV">Letter XXV</a> he speaks
to Miss Brawne of his “feeding upon sham victuals.”
In the letter to Dilke he says: “If I can
keep off inflammation for the next six weeks, I trust
I shall do very well.” In <a href="#LETTER_XXV">Letter XXV</a> he expresses
to Miss Brawne the hope that he may go out for a
walk with her on the 1st of May. If these correspondences
may be trusted, we are now dealing with
letters of the first week in March, of which period
there are still indications in <a href="#LETTER_XXVIII">Letter XXVIII</a>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> The reference to Barry Cornwall and the cold
weather indicate that this letter was written about
the 4th of March, 1820; for in the letter to Mr. Dilke,
with the Hampstead postmark of that date, already
referred to (<a href="#Page_73">see page 73</a>), Keats recounts this same
affair of the books evidently as a quite recent transaction,
and says he “shall not expect Mrs. Dilke at
Hampstead next week unless the weather changes
for the warmer.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> It is of no real consequence what had been
said about “old Mr. Dilke,” the grandfather of the
first baronet and the father of Keats’s acquaintance;
but it is to be noted that this curious letter might
have been a little more self-explanatory, had it not
been mutilated. The lower half of the second leaf
has been cut off,—by whom, the owners can only
conjecture.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> The piece cut off the original letter is in this
instance so small that nothing can be wanting except
the signature,—probably given to an autograph-collector.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> This extreme bitterness of feeling must have
supervened, one would think, in increased bodily
disease; for the letter was clearly written after the
parting of Keats and Brown at Gravesend, which
took place on the 7th of May, 1819, and on which
occasion there is every reason to think that the friends
were undivided in attachment. I imagine Keats
would gladly have seen Brown within a week of this
time had there been any opportunity.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> This question may perhaps be fairly taken to
indicate the lapse of a month from the time when
Keats left the house at Hampstead next door to Miss
Brawne’s, at which he probably knew her employments
well enough from day to day. If so, the time
would be about the first week in June, 1819.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> He was seemingly in a different phase of belief
from that in which the death of his brother Tom
found him. At that time he recorded that he and
Tom both firmly believed in immortality. See <cite>Life,
Letters, &amp;c.</cite>, Vol. I, p. 246. A further indication
of his having shifted from the moorings of orthodoxy
may be found in the expression in <a href="#LETTER_XXXV">Letter XXXV</a>,
“I appeal to you by the blood of that Christ you
believe in:”—not “<em>we</em> believe in.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> This seems to mean that he wrote the letter to
the end, and then filled in the words <i>My dearest Girl</i>,
left out lest any one coming near him should chance
to see them. These words are written more heavily
than the beginning of the letter, and indicate a state
of pen corresponding with that shown by the words
<i>God bless you</i> at the end.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54" id="Footnote_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> This letter appears to belong between those of
the 8th and 25th of July, 1819; and of the two
Thursdays between these dates it seems likelier that
the 15th would be the one than that the letter should
have been written so near the 25th as on the 22nd.
The original having been mislaid, I have not been
able to take the evidence of the postmark. It will
be noticed that at the close he speaks of a weekly
exchange of letters with Miss Brawne; and by
placing this letter at the 15th this programme is
pretty nearly realized so far as Keats’s letters from the
Isle of Wight are concerned.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> The story in question is one of the many derivatives
from the Third Calender’s Story in <cite>The Thousand
and One Nights</cite> and the somewhat similar tale of
“The Man who laughed not,” included in the Notes
to Lane’s <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> and in the text of Payne’s
magnificent version of the complete work. I am
indebted to Dr. Reinhold Köhler, Librarian of the
Grand-ducal Library of Weimar, for identifying the
particular variant referred to by Keats as the “Histoire
de la Corbeille,” in the <cite>Nouveaux Contes Orientaux</cite>
of the Comte de Caylus. Mr. Morris’s beautiful poem
“The Man who never laughed again,” in <cite>The Earthly
Paradise</cite>, has familiarized to English readers one
variant of the legend.</p>
